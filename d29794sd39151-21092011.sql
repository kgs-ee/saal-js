INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (20,'\"Can?t get No / Satisfaction\"','<p>After a pause one of the most internationally acclaimed contemporary Estonian choreographers, Mart Kangro is back again in SAAL with a new solo.<br /><br />The core of Mart Kangro&rsquo;s aesthetic language could probably be summed up as a tension between two sides. Everyday actions in close-up on the one hand. And a commentary on commonplace contemporary performance art forms laying bare the way these function and are perceived.<br /><br />All of this has an aim, a target. He makes use of his own and the audience&rsquo;s previous experience and prejudices in having seen grand shows and spectacles. Laying bare their structure and reflecting back the hopes of the audience Kangro leads the spectators into seeing his performance as what it is, not what it is not. For this he uses various types of stage games that lead the spectator into thinking about the paradoxes and forces around how a stage performance is perceived. What he does is a commentary on experience. He leads the audience into awareness of their own perception and finding their own unmediated approach to the work onstage. He makes the spectator realise his preconceptions and hopes, kind of left-over from previously viewed performances. Spectacular episodes exist in his shows but at places where one wouldn&rsquo;t expect them.<br /><br />In his new solo &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get No / Satisfaction&rdquo; Mart Kangro will try to investigate how it affects the performer to know that what he does depends directly on the reaction of the audience. That it is only through a certain agreement with the audience that the performer is on stage at all. What compromises are necessary on the part of the performer in order for his artistic idea to be received and to be able to satisfy the audience?<br /><br />The audience has the justified right to an emotional recharge. On the other hand, the artist has the right to be understood and give to the audience his artistic idea. A conflict? Possibly. Both sides collide and create a paradoxical situation.<br /><br />Possibly one of the most internationally acclaimed contemporary Estonian choreographers <strong>Mart Kangro</strong> focuses in his work on the meanings the body and movements create and the concept of meaning in theatre as a semiotic time-space. Kangro has been engaged as a dancer at the Estonian National Opera. As a choreographer he has for a long time collaborated with Christina Ciupke and Thomas Lehmen. He has created 8 full-length dance pieces that have been presented in more than 20 countries all over Europe and North America.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Idea and performance: <strong>Mart Kangro</strong><br />Music: <strong>Taavi Kerikm&auml;e</strong><br />Dramaturgical assistance: <strong>Petra Roggel, Christina Ciupke</strong><br />Technical solutions: <strong>Kalle Tikas</strong><br />Co-produced by: <strong>Kanuti Gildi SAAL, Baltoscandal 2010 festival </strong>(Rakvere, Estonia)<strong>, De Internationale Keuze van de Rotterdamse Schouwburg, Kunstenfestivaledesarts Brussels</strong><br />Project co-produced by <strong>NXTSTP</strong>, with the support of the <strong>Culture Programme of the European Union</strong><br />Supported by: <strong>Cultural Endowment of Estonia</strong><br />Premiere: <strong>21.01.09 Kanuti Gildi SAAL</strong><strong></strong><br />NB!

The show they are doing in Kanuti Gildi SAAL has been shown at different Lokaals in Europe and all over the world. The group comes together every once in a while. The audience will certainly hear their infamous piece &ldquo;Money&rdquo; and other well-known and much heard songs.<br /><br />The repertoire of the duet Kann/Valkep&auml;&auml; consists of very varied pieces. They have been inspired by the old rock legend Mark Lanegan as well as Ali Farka Toure. 2 guitars and an overwhelming voice that will however leave space for physical movement. It will most certainly not leave the audience tepid as the Kann/Valkeap&auml;&auml; duet has received both very positive and very negative responses, they have been loved and hated. It is obvious that the band enjoys their performance sharing this delight with the audience even though their songs lack classic structure and easily recognizable reprises.<br /><br /><strong>Kaja Kann</strong> (1973) is known for her unconventional mastery of vocal and guitar techniques. One thing is certain &ndash; she enjoys movement and smoky clubs. Kaja Kann has messed around on stage on many more occasions than she would like remembering. And she keeps doing it again and again. Kaja sais that it is enjoyable to wander alone and then discover that she is with Juha and it is especially terrific if the audience is present as well. This is not witty choreography, this is dance.<br /><br />Already in his early years <strong>Juha Valkeap&auml;&auml; </strong>(1967) made bizarre sounds to express himself. In his teens he discovered the electric guitar following the pattern of Jimmy Hendrix. Besides this duet he has been part of several folk, punk-rock, alternative sound space and improvisational projects. He likes to take risks. Sometimes it seems like he can understand his partner even without words, without composing.

It will most certainly not leave the audience tepid as the Kann/Valkeap&auml;&auml; duet has received both very positive and very negative responses, they have been loved and hated. It is obvious that the band enjoys their performance sharing this delight with the audience even though their songs lack classic structure and easily recognizable reprises.<br /><br /><strong>Kaja Kann</strong> (1973) is known for her unconventional mastery of vocal and guitar techniques. One thing is certain &ndash; she enjoys movement and smoky clubs. Kaja Kann has messed around on stage on many more occasions than she would like remembering. And she keeps doing it again and again. Kaja has said that it is enjoyable to wander alone and then discover that she is with Juha and it is especially terrific if the audience is present as well. This is not witty choreography, this is dance.<br /><br />Already in his early years <strong>Juha Valkeap&auml;&auml;</strong> (1967) made bizarre sounds to express himself. In his teens he discovered the electric guitar following the pattern of Jimmy Hendrix.

It is played on a squared board of 19 by 19 squares one player  having black and the other white stones. Taking turns the players place the stones on the board. One can move ones stones to every crossing of lines that is vacant. The aim of each player is to fully surround the stones of the other player with one\'s own.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The rules of the game are clear and practical, yet the game itself is deeply human and strategic. In China, the Go-game is known as wei-qi, in Korea as baduk-i and in as Japan igo.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This production comes to be thanks to many good people!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ursulla Vanam&ouml;lder</strong> has for seven years worked in Estonian Drama Theatre in Tallinn.

With the years the festival has come to be a renowned early autumn festival in the Nordic Countries and all of Europe being the most well known festival of contemporary dance in Estonia.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is a festival known for its nonchalant atmosphere enjoyed both by the participants and the audience. The productions will this year be shown at Kanuti Gildi SAAL and at the other theatres and public space venues in Tallinn. As it is a jubilee for the festival the programme is made with the widest audience in mind. Performances taking place in public parks and streets will be free of charge and are suitable for families.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme of the jubilee edition of August DanceFestival can be described with the word \"synthesis\" for the programme brings together both some of the best choreographers in Europe today and the best choreographers of the emerging generation. Besides there is also a synthesis of different fields of art: dance and machines, dance and sport, dance and technology, dance and theatre, dance and art, dance and music etc. Besides performances at theatre venues the festival will also feature works in public parks and streets. This diversity should help to create a particular atmosphere suitable for a jubilee festival.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Beside choreographers from Estonia the festival also welcomes performers from the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and Canada. It is hard to point out a culmination event of the festival for thanks to long time efforts we have managed to invite guests that are as diverse as they are original.</p>\r\n<p>Yet most probably the main guest of the festival is the well known and renowned choreographer <strong>Thomas Hauert</strong> who will come to Estonia with \"Accords\", a production that saw its premiere last year and can now be see at virtually every major dance festival in Europe.

Accompanied by the dramatic voice of Maria Callas, this meeting between iron and flesh is a witty interpretation of the pas de deux dance tradition. Playful yet rugged, &ldquo;Transports Exceptionnels&rdquo; is an unexpected moment of grace between fragile man and indestructible machine.<br /><br /><em>Est-ce un fantasme d\'enfant ? Est-ce l\'id&eacute;e de se retrouver, apr&egrave;s toutes ces ann&eacute;es, avec sa grue de gamin ?<br />Par son gigantisme, la machine cr&eacute;e une tension avec le corps du danseur. C\'est aussi une rencontre inattendue, un duo entre fer et chair.<br />J\'utilise le bras de la pelleteuse pour sa fonctionnalit&eacute; et sa dynamique, mais aussi comme un bras humain qui prend, repousse ou cajole !<br />La rotation de la machine est un mouvement ample , spectaculaire mais il peut aussi &eacute;voquer un man&egrave;ge. Le godet, dont la fonction est de gratter, de forer, de transporter et de d&eacute;verser, offre une extension po&eacute;tique :une main qui porte, qui &eacute;l&egrave;ve et qui prot&egrave;ge.<br />Si parfois j\'imagine la machine comme un &ecirc;tre humain rude et imparfait - &agrave; l\'image de Boris KARLOFF dans Frankenstein - je tente &eacute;galement de toucher au merveilleux , au vertige du r&ecirc;ve de La Belle et la B&ecirc;te .<br />Une machine, dans sa puissance, son &eacute;l&eacute;gance et sa beaut&eacute; peut aussi bien &eacute;voquer les travaux d\'Hercule que le monde industriel peint par Fernand L&Eacute;GER.<br />La pelleteuse et le danseur ?

Il d&eacute;couvre l&rsquo;enseignement de NIKOLA&Iuml;S avec Catherine ATLANI puis Carolyn CARLSON et les danseurs du GRCOP alors en r&eacute;sidence &agrave; l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra de Paris. En 1978, sa premi&egrave;re pi&egrave;ce Quelle fut ta soif ? remporte le Prix de l\'Humour au Concours de Bagnolet. &Eacute;t&eacute; 79, il cr&eacute;e pour le Festival d&rsquo;Avignon un solo L&rsquo;homme cheval compos&eacute; de gestes minuscules et orchestr&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on math&eacute;matique. Il obtient en d&eacute;cembre 1979 une bourse d\'&eacute;tude d&rsquo;un an pour une formation &agrave; New York o&ugrave; il suit les cours de Merce Cunningham, Douglas DUNN, Lucinda CHILDS et Meg HARPER. Invit&eacute; &agrave; rejoindre la compagnie du CNDC d&rsquo;Angers, alors dirig&eacute; par Alwin NIKOLA&Iuml;S, il rencontre plusieurs danseurs avec qui il cr&eacute;e en septembre 1981 Beau Geste, collectif compos&eacute; de Christine Graz, Isabelle Job, Marc LAWTON, Agn&egrave;s DAVID, Christine ERB&Eacute; et Philippe PRIASSO, ces deux derniers faisant toujours partie de la compagnie. Il va, durant les ann&eacute;es 80, alterner interpr&eacute;tation chez D&eacute;coufl&Eacute; ou Larrieu et cr&eacute;ations chor&eacute;graphiques sous forme de solos (solo 2 1981, Nuit Blanche 1982, solo 2 bis 1983), de pi&egrave;ces avec Beau Geste (V&eacute;nus et les Toutous 1982, d&eacute;sir d&eacute;sir 1983, Strada Fox 1984, Princes de Paris 1985&hellip;) et avec d\'autres groupes : GRAND MAGASIN (Strip-tease 1985), Louis ZIEGLER (Climat d\'amour 1988) ou LOLITA (Zoopsie Comedi 1986). En association avec G&eacute;rard PESSON et Caroline GAUTIER il se frotte &agrave; la bande dessin&eacute;e de Rodolphe T&Ouml;PFFER pour Les Amours de Monsieur Vieux Bois (1991). La m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e, il invente pour sa chienne Rita, un duo d&rsquo;amour Belles de nuit. Pour la biennale de Lyon en 1992, il revisite Carmen l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre de Bizet. Il signe en 1997 la chor&eacute;graphie d&rsquo;Orph&eacute;e aux Enfers (mise en sc&egrave;ne Laurent PELLY) pr&eacute;sent&eacute; &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve et Lyon, ainsi que Casse-Noisette pour le Ballet de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra National de Lyon en 2001.<br /><br /><strong>Cie.Beau Geste</strong> est cr&eacute;&eacute; en 1981 par sept danseurs issus du Centre National de Danse Contemporaine dirig&eacute; par le chor&eacute;graphe am&eacute;ricain Alwin NIKOLA&iuml;S.<br />Sous la forme d\'un collectif artistique o&ugrave; s\'&eacute;changent diff&eacute;rents points de vue esth&eacute;tiques - chaque danseur &eacute;tant alternativement chor&eacute;graphe ou interpr&egrave;te - BEAU GESTE d&eacute;veloppe &agrave; travers ses cr&eacute;ations collectives ou individuelles un &eacute;tat d\'esprit commun nourri par la diversit&eacute; des potentiels artistiques des membres qui le composent.<br />En 1991, la direction artistique est confi&eacute;e &agrave; Dominique BOIVIN.

The second. White. The scorpion. Two natures that are reflected in the expression, in the behaviour, in the movement. It seems there is a vague, remote reference to the \"cartoons\", to the \"animation\". From time to time it is possible to listen to broken voices, moved by an agony. Might these voices be bits of cartoons that are deposited in our memory? Black eyelashes, excessively long, surround the dark eyes of the two beings, the Cock and the Scorpion. Melancholic looks come out of the faces and a strange and powerful pride wraps them. Everything outcrops, a little bit and time after time. The Cock\'s movement is haughty; it scans and observes the area as if it was the keeper of a mystery. The Scorpion\'s movement is the precise, certain and mental stillness of the one who is in a standstill before attacking. There is an intangible, indescribable and arcane elegance. The red of the Cock, its colour becomes its movement. The white of the Scorpion, its suspension becomes its voice. The black of the area becomes the time of a void relation. Perhaps I stand before an idea of cartoon. Just that.<br />Teodora Castellucci<br /><br /><strong>Teodora Castellucci</strong> was born in Cesena, Italy.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (88,'','<p>In her interdisciplinary dance performance, Cologne-based choreographer Silke Z. explores the idea of the private sphere. Her work is a convergence of live performance, video installation and narrative film. A male and female dancer create an emotional landscape shaped by the dynamic interplay between closeness and distance, control and powerlessness. Private spheres emerge from which the audience cannot escape &ndash; they move throughout an installation that surrounds the performance on all four sides. The traditional stage is replaced by a space in which everyone shares in a common experience.<br />&ldquo;private spaces (the p.s. project)&rdquo; was created during residencies spent in Tallinn, Newcastle and D&uuml;sseldorf. In her choreography work, Silke Z. intensively examines interpersonal relationships and encounters between performers and audiences. In her last project, &ldquo;machMut&rdquo;, from the 2007 series Mutproben, the performers she worked with included young adults. &ldquo;machtMut&rdquo; received the 2008 K&ouml;lner Tanz und Theaterpreis (Cologne Dance and Theatre Prize) and was nominated for the 2008 German theatre award DER FAUST. &ldquo;private spaces (the p.s. project)&rdquo; received also the K&ouml;lner Tanz und Theaterpreis 2008 (Cologne Dance and Theatre Prize)<br /><br /><em>The line between discomfort and pain has long been crossed as the incredible performer Antonio Cabrita repeatedly hurls himself onto the floor in an attempt to finally illicit a reaction from his self-composed Caroline Simon with his self destruction. For the audience, there is nothing in space separating them from the performers; they are together in the same black enclosure. There is no longer an external world, only mercilessly exposed inner worlds. They want to run. They want to stay.<br />The audience personally experiences the dualism of society\'s need for discretion and curiosity about other people\'s private spheres. At what point is our search for authenticity shameful, when is it truly courageous?<br />In her outstanding production, Silke Z. probes the terror and beauty of intimacy. She has once again succeeded in succinctly capturing a current and indeterminate phenomenon that defies general explanation.<br />Reality, for Silke Z., is bouquet of splinters. Beautiful to behold &ndash; but with dangerously sharp edges. <br />Nicole Strecker, K&ouml;lner Tanzpreis award speech</em><br /><br /><strong>Silke Z.</strong> born in 1970, lives and works as an independent choreographer in Cologne.

In IT\'S IN THE AIR, Ingvartsen and van Dinther ask the question: how can we perceive the body as a body; as expressive qualities generated through movement? IT\'S IN THE AIR unravels the body in the nexus between the human-cultural and the natural-physical, between will, effort and desire and mechanical laws and conditions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A female and male body grow organically into body-machines, natural, yet against nature as a habit. They jump, bounce, flip, flop, ripple, slide, levitate, reverberate, shiver, rub, tick, explode... Bodies that defy the laws of motion and rest, the joy of muscles being moved, the many nuances of rhythm, density, texture, the tactility of movement, in virtuosity that elicits pure joy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jefta van Dinther </strong>is a choreographer/dancer living in Amsterdam and Berlin.

But for the next hour or so, Mette Ingvartsen and Jefta van Dinther will no longer stand still. (...) After near-static movements at the beginning, a rhythm suddenly imposes itself on the play through the screeching noise of the springs, a substitute for music. (...) Ingvartsen and van Dinther shed new light on everyday movements by performing them in the air. The movements thus become meaningful, though the choreography never suggests a specific interpretation, the simple and subdued stage direction allowing each figure to produce a new - and alltoo- familiar - image. (...) Ingvartsen and van Dinther literally perform a feasibility study of the human body: their virtuoso dance performance explores the boundaries between free and wilful movement and its culturally conditioned codes. (...) While in dance theatre the movement of the body is not an unusual topic, the idea to relocate the action in the air proves as convincing as its straightforward implementation.\"<br />Sarah Heppekausen, WAZ, 16.06.08</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>&bdquo;(...) But here come Mette Ingvartsen and Jefta van Dinther. The Danish-born Mette Ingvartsen (...) is familiar with theory and postmodern philosophy. Ingvartsen is furthermore gifted with an astute sense of irony. (...) The result of their investigation can now be seen on stage and takes the shape of two large trampolines. For more than 50 minutes, the two dancers are heartily jumping, hopping and bouncing on the springboards. For once, the fact that spectators are merely allowed to watch is somewhat cruel. (...) &bdquo;It\'s in the Air\" is a concert in movement, a circus number, a reflection on dance, a children\'s game, a piece of existential wisdom... It\'s astonishing to see how much sense can be drawn from such a simple construction: two people jumping on a trampoline - and taking off, physically as well as intellectually speaking.\"<br />Nicole Strecker, ballettanz, August/September 2008</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>&bdquo;Another climax is Mette Ingvartsens and Jefta van Dinthers production &bdquo;It\'s in the air\" - a performance with two dancers on two huge trampolines. The dancers start with careful bounces, that slowly increases to different figures and movements: lurching wild through the air, bouncing from the back to the feet, on all four, bouncing very high till nearly reaching the stage ceiling, or very softly fare from each other or intensely hugged. The trampolines allow completely new movements, qualities, dynamics, and combinations, on top the jumping has a kinaesthetic effect on the public: dizziness, feeling nauseous. A very convincing idea, that gets to move as well the head and body of the spectator.\"<br />Elisabeth Nehring, Deutschland Radio Kultur, FAZIT, 21.08.08</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>&bdquo;TOPP-ACHIEVEMENT BY PERFORMERS-TRANSCENDENTAL EXPEREINCES ON THE TRAMPOLINE (...) An as simple as solid discovery constitutes the basic idea/starting point: two tribunes, two trampolines and a man and a woman as jumping performers. Perfectly synchronized they hypnotize the gaze of the spectator. The ever-present drone of the springs produces a compelling rhythm. Again and again they manage to shift into yet another surprising variation, sometimes minimal, sometimes rupturing, but always effective and impressive. A body that at the highest point pushes itself higher.

It marked the end of a five year collaboration with Lila Greene (Les Productions Lima Dreem) and celebrated the founding of the company I.D.A. (International Dreems Associated).</p>\r\n<p>In 1976, Jacqueline Robinson, whom I had met about a year after my arrival in Paris, invited me to present an evening in her studio Avenue Junot. I created naked traces, my first full length solo. For the first time I introduced Doris Dreem, a character who would reappear again and again in performances over the next 8 years. In 1977, Doris\' partner John Dreem made his first appearance in love letters, and the following year in another solo, each one\'s own. I played both roles.</p>\r\n<p>When Lila and I began working together in 1978, we decided to continue exploring the relationship between John and Doris by doubling their presences on stage. Each played Doris, each played John. We created Double Sens, Sweet Dreems and A Voile et &agrave; Vapeur. Our last creation together in 1982, La S&eacute;paration de Biens, was actually composed of two solos, Lila\'s Swooning Slugs and the first version of empty holes. My solo was inspired and informed by my collaboration with the lighting designer Alain de Cheveign&eacute; and his fascinating use of shadows. Working with the demultiplication of my own dancing shadow, I spent two thirds of the performance behind a screen. John and Doris were not involved. <br />To make the transition from the fruitful collaboration with Lila to my new role of company director, I decided to make a new and definitive version by reinjecting John and Doris into the solo - empty holes - the life and love and death of John and Doris Dreem. The performance took many of the themes and obsessions I had been exploring and developing since my arrival in Paris in 1973 : life and love and death ; questions about identity and gender ; the multiplication and mirrors of self and other ; the combination of movement, voice, text, song, light and sound into complex and composite images. It allowed me to conclude and faire le deuil of my early years in Paris and make a bridge to the next step - creating a company, developing and directing larger groups, transmitting my ideas and visions to other collaborators - performers, musicians, sc&eacute;nographers, lighting designers...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the years I have almost systematically shifted back and forth from solo to group projects. The process of making solos is by nature solitary, but the exhilaration and depth of solo performance is extremely instructive and rewarding. It has always been a way of searching, defining and verifying for myself the materials and tools I wish to transmit and share with the performers in the group pieces. Group processes are more social - playful, conflictual and gregarious - and because of the number facilitate the construction of complex images.</p>\r\n<p>A complex image is an image with several dimensions - first of all the surface appeal, the seemingly superficial face value. What you see. The first degree. Then there is the contradiction, contained in the image through the accumulation and distribution of antinomic forces. What you see is never what you get. The second degree. Then are added, through processes of association, citation and reference, all the other imaginable and even unimaginable meanings, inversions, contradictions and countermeanings. A complex image obliges the spectator to work, to wonder, to reflect, to construct his or her own point of view from what is given. And honestly, I love when the spectator works.</p>\r\n<p>I have never done nor desired to do a reconstruction of any of my pieces. Every new work is a unique and lively process, made with and for specific people, places and times. When it dies, it is gone. My repertory consists solely of pieces that have been performed continually since their creation and currently includes Hommages, four solos dating from 1989 to 1998, presented together since 1998, Song and Dance (2003), ANIMAL Male (2005) and ANIMAL Female (2007).</p>\r\n<p>empty holes was performed ten times after its creation in 1983. It is the only piece I have ever really seriously considered reconstructing because it contains the seeds of almost all the themes and obsessions which have pursued me over the years. But other projects always came along that took priority. Now, twenty five years later, I have decided to reenact it, in the sense of visiting an old friend who you have not seen for many years. It brings back a flood of memories from the past, enters again the filter of the present and acts as a catalyser for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Mark Tompkins, january 2007</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Concept, texts, songs and interpretation: <strong>Mark Tompkins</strong> (except \"non je ne regrette rien\": Vaucaire/Dumont, \"strangers in the night\": Kaempfert/Singleton/Snyder, \"am i blue\": Clark/Akst, \"last dance\": Jabara)<br />Dramaturgy and stage direction: <strong>Gerard Gourdot</strong><br />Light: <strong>Alain de Cheveign&eacute;</strong><br />Technical direction: <strong>Rodolphe Martin</strong><br />Songs by: <strong>Mark Tompkins &amp; Nuno Rebelo, Vaucaire/Dumont, Kaempfert/Singleton/Snyder, Clark/Akst, Jabara</strong><br />Created april 1983 at the Festival Bonjour in Perpignan and reenacted october 2008 <br />with Marseille Objectif Danse at Festival actOral.7, Marseille and at Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Cit&eacute; internationale, Paris.<br />Tallinn performance is supported by <strong>French Cultural Centre</strong> and <strong>CulturesFrance</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.idamarktompkins.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">http://www.idamarktompkins.com/</span></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The following texts come from the original 1983 dossier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>empty holes is the accumulation, the synthesis, the high point of a lifetime love story, and of ten years of making work.

She came to Europe and made her first stage appearance in 1976, in naked traces. In the fall of the same year, she performed with her big sister in be:fore:plays. In 1977, she met JOHN DREEM in love letters, and their relationship blossomed in Les Gens Qui Habitent dans Les Maisons de Verre I.</p>\r\n<p>The tragic rupture of their liason the following year in each ones own left DORIS full of despair, but gave birth to VIDINE DREEM, the enigmatic child, and at the same time permitted the encounter of the true double, the real twin, and the formation of the couple JohnetDoris et JohnetDoris Dreem.</p>\r\n<p>The DREEMS relationship expanded and thrived with the adventure of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Autarcique in Les Gens Qui Habitent dans Les Maisons de Verre II -VI and elsewere - Louche Mouche, Double Sens, Sweet Dreems, A Voile et &agrave; Vapeur...Unfortunately, the stress of modern life being as it is, and love stories being as they are, the couple slowly disintegrated, leaving however a work structure, Les Productions Lima Dreem.</p>\r\n<p>Since its initial creation in 1982, empty holes has undergone a number of radical transformations until finding its definite form, presented for the first time at the Festival de Perpignan in april 1983. Once again reunited, John et Doris play together for the last time before disappearing definitively - empty holes - the life and love and death of John et Doris Dreem.<br />WORK</p>\r\n<p>Anything that is is quite enough if it is. Gertrude Stein</p>\r\n<p>Mark Tompkins plays with crossing borders, exploring the cracks and ambiguities of frontiers, juggling with the in-betweens, using anything and refusing nothing which seems necessary for a precise proposition.</p>\r\n<p>Forms - choreographic, theatrical or musical, improvised or meticulously composed. Spaces - interior or exterior, classical theatres or urban spaces, private houses or abandoned factories. Matters - physical : dancing, acting, gesture, action ; sound : words, texts, songs, recordings ; visual : slides, videos, shadows.</p>\r\n<p>He always endeavours to question the form, the composition and the play, as well as the relationship between the performer and the audience. Exploring the diffraction and breaking up of traditional space and time, working in &laquo; non theatrical &raquo; spaces or environments of &laquo; instant composition &raquo;, researching &laquo; extra-ordinary &raquo; acting states both realistic and abstract, questioning the role and activity of the spectator. These are some of the principal preoccupations in his work. The notions of interdependancy and interactive simultaneity are the fundamental basics of his research, both at the level of the elaboration as the well as the execution of the work itself.</p>\r\n<p>If the performances of Mark Tompkins are often radically different from each another, there is still a main theme, a constant, which nourishes the work and demands its perpetual renewal. The fragile and feverish research of the least commom denominateur, of the essential act. Neither too much, nor too little. Just. And the paradox, the contradiction, fully accepted, that once it is named it is no longer .<br />WHAT YOU SEE IS NEVER WHAT YOU GET</p>\r\n<p>The episodes of the Dreem saga always revolve around the same story, a story which is not really a story. A story of impossible love.</p>\r\n<p>This story is told using whatever type of support is considered necessary in a given situation : videos, slides, shadows, objects, sets, texts, voice, sound and recordings, actions, movements. The work of composition consists in writing a scenario by simultaneously associating layers of sound and images to create an audiovisual space which tells not one but several stories. By superposition, by juxtaposition, by interference, the elements begin to call and respond to one another in complete interdependancy. At once a collage of heterogenous elements, but also a d&eacute;collage in the sense that an element can transform, enhance or remove the meaning from another. A perpetual striptease where the unveiling must not show everything but suggest what remains hidden.</p>\r\n<p>The elements used are both general and personal, even autobiographical. In this sense, John and Doris do not exist, have never existed, will never exist. They are lies to propel the scenario forward, to give a semblance of fiction where there is only real life. It is by their presence that John and Doris pass from one state to another outside of any psychological frame. So that the play is both theatrical, in the manner that the states engender each other emotionally, and choreographic, in the manner that the states provoke one another in an abstract way, to the point that they coexist simultaneously, without falling into the pure abstractions of dance.</p>\r\n<p>John et Doris Dreem walk on the razor\'s edge where the scenario prevents abstraction from winning, but where the abstraction bursts upon an ambiguous space which opens unkown and unnameable states. And which seduces them and towards which they run.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[popimg] empty-holes-01.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-02.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-03.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-04.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-05.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg]</p>',1,'','<p>August DanceFestival 2009:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"suur\">MARK TOMPKINS</span> /FRANCE/ <span class=\"keskmine\">\"empty holes\"</span></p>');

Dance performance \"Tavaj\".</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"TAVAJ!\" is a project initiated by Renzo van Steenbergen, Alissa &Scaron;naider and P&auml;&auml;r P&auml;renson. The aim of this project is to investigate the differences between Estonians and the Russian speaking minority living in Estonia. Using language, cultural background and daily habits the stage will be transformed into a world that symbolizes the transition field between these differences. Three people, all with different background, will be working together, giving and taking impulses and substance from each other. The aim is to involve as much people as possible in the research by sharing ideas, opinions and experiences. The situation proceeds to be neither a competition either a coalition between the different people. After all everything originates from the people\'s mind. With this research, the performance and its process we will question broader behaviour between the different cultures. How much are we controlled by \"unconscious prejudice\" mechanisms in society and our everyday lives? Language and daily habits are parts of our social identity. We think that we understand who our fellow citizens are and how they are really doing... but reality is that most of the time we hardly understand even the simplest cultural differences. <br />How will it end if we try to reconstruct and solve the battle between different backgrounds, norms and values now in 2009? Will this research be only about the difference between Russian-Estonians and Estonians living in Estonia or is it possible to see the similarities with other countries and situations globally.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>And so it was. Hapukurk on the table, a fairy on a branch of a tree. A passing by tram showed me smeh skvoz slezy in its window. And I smiled while I was being watched by Ivan Durak who touched his shoulder and disappeared. After crossing the right upper corner of Russkaya Dusha I bumped into Kalevipoeg who hit me directly into my soul. While Russkaja Baba v Izbe was still dreaming with her best friends. Belka I Strelka were born but were never asked to. Izbushka na kuryich nozhkah at that particular moment was wearing three stripes in red colour. Neverland seems too far away from fear under the Pakt Molotova-Rippentropa. While she was running on, not willing to see. Every now and then cheburek was passing, kama far away, vodka very close, but nothing there. \"Kolm L&otilde;vi\" he said out loud.</em></p>\r\n<p><br /><em>FAQ<br />- So it will be a dance piece?<br />- Yes.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Renzo van Steenbergen</strong> (1977) is as an autonomous all-round artist working in the fields of installation art, music and composition, film, contemporary theatre and live-cinema.

The focus is on pop\'s affective world of passion and its reinterpretations, hommages, identifications, and criticisms in the interdisciplinary performance culture; copulations with band structures and the world of stardom, idiosyncratic identification experiences, a personal and truly individualized \"Club Adorator\": a frenzied world of desire, depression, sexuality, acquisition, despair, euphoria, na&iuml;vet&eacute;, narcissism, corporality, fantasy, cool, perversion, power, freedom and money.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Relying on Freud, Lacan smashed the mystifying romantic treatment of an artist as a (suffering) genius with just a snap of the fingers by reinterpreting this in the language of psychopathology. His treatment does not see an artist as self-destructive person with divine talent but someone who has just dug deeper in the examination of people\'s darker side of - artists do nothing but meet up with the id, as they are more familiar with the unconscious than ordinary people. Therefore, an artist is no more \"divine\" than a common degenerate with elevated perceptions, but not every degenerate is an artist. It seems that the artist is possessed by a secret that his or her art is able to conjure up. It\'s as if artists were closer to this imperceptible great Thing from which we are all unavoidably separated, and which in turn, sets off a desire machine within us. Makes us desire them, and their mystery. It\'s as if they know and are showing us something that we do not know.</p>\r\n<p>Although Freud treated artists as soft neurotics, Lacan did not consider the pedantic use of psychoanalysis suitable for the analysis of art. On one hand, artistic sublimation is supposed to have a socializing impact - thus culture, not pathology - on the other hand, in the substantive sense artists are always ahead of analysts. All the same, Lacan\'s art is the art of drive, compulsion and inevitability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lacan\'s treatment assumes that artists have an affective, direct relationship with the unconscious. However, in postmodern cultural space, this relationship is inevitably objectified and conceptualized - taken to a playful meta-level. Yet, today, Lacan\'s theory seems to apply best to the center of the desire industry that is pop culture - desire industrialized by the pop industry.</p>\r\n<p>This year\'s festival attempts to delve deeper into the pop and rock &lsquo;n\' roll experience and by recycling it to arrive at new heights. We see bands that are performed as art and we see art that performs like bands. The fans, groupies, anti- and pseudo-stars, \"professors\" and others are all here. Our method is indifference. The party goes on. Only despair is pitched from the left and right. Our fantasies have a very large screen and we want to see ourselves there.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Produced by: <strong>MT&Uuml; Uue Performantsi Selts</strong><br />Curators: <strong>Anders H&auml;rm, Priit Raud</strong><br />Team: <strong>Mairika Plakso, Revo Koplus, Eneli J&auml;rs, Annika &Uuml;prus, Toomas &Uuml;bner</strong><br />Graphic design: <strong>Martin Pedanik</strong><br />Translations: <strong>Anders H&auml;rm, Juta Ristsoo</strong><br />Photo: <strong>Laura Kallasvee</strong></p>\r\n<p>Supporters: <strong>Cultural Endowment of Estonia, Gambling Tax Council, Royal Embassy of Norway, Embassy of Sweden, French Cultural Centre in Tallinn, Reval Hotels Group, Kunsthalle Tallinn, Kanuti Gildi SAAL</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong></p>',1,'','<p class=\"suur\"><strong>NU PERFORMANCE FESTIVAL III</strong><strong>: Recycle POP</strong></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"keskmine\">11-14.11.2009 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /></span></p>');

They traveled from place to place, building a tent to a field and waiting for audience to arrive. On one fine day a small girl sat in the audience, she was thrilled and shouted: \"This is beautiful!

But strange things have started happening. The hula-hoop is chasing after the artist, clubs run from the juggler, acrobats feed of their younger days and air-acrobats don\'t make the difference between air and land. <br />The only thing that could save the circus from the curse is a young person, who\'d shout: \"This is pointless, i\'ll show you how it\'s done!\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is already the third time we can present a circus premiere by OMAtsirkus in December at Kanuti Gildi SAAL.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (140,'','<p>Interactive Cinema has existed since at least 1967, yet rarely do such films get created for, and experienced by, a \"live\" audience in a cinema or theatre. \"Cause and Effect\" presents an original and experimental performance of recently-made short interactive films, created by Dr. Chris Hales and Teijo Pellinen, with which the whole audience becomes involved through the use of varied interaction modalities. In a show lasting about 75 minutes, eight or nine different short films are presented, each with a different subject matter and method of interaction. In each case it is the entire audience that affects the film, usually by a collaborative process. The show is both entertaining and intellectual and appeals to a wide audience. Certain films are customised for the actual theatre and the language of the country in which the show takes place during a rapid pre-production phase at the location itself. This localisation adds to the audience\'s surprise and involvement with the films presented to them.

One aspect of the PhD was to examine the creation and effect of interactive movies for a \"live\" group situation. He has exhibited interactive movies internationally since 1995 at film/video/new media festivals and art exhibitions, written book chapters and scholarly articles, published cdroms, and taught about 100 interactive moving image workshops throughout Europe. He recently researched Raduz Cincera\'s Czechoslovak interactive cinema \"Kinoautomat\" from 1967 and was instrumental in helping it to be restaged for the first time since the 1970s. Chris holds a position of Post Doctoral Research Fellow in Interactive Film at UEL\'s SMARTlab (London) as well as being a regular visiting lecturer at numerous educational establishments in Europe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Teijo Pellinen</strong> is well known in the film, video and artistic circles of Helsinki.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (151,'','<p><em>\"This is a show that is based on the honesty and directness of music. The fourth wall must be destroyed\"</em> - L&otilde;o</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When artist and musician Andres L&otilde;o released his first solo album, Skeletons on Rock, on the Austrian record label Laton in February 2009, he had already been performing this material for three years on stages in various European cities and been the warm-up performer for such famous bands as Mouse on Mars and Black Dice. The catchwords of the album were wave-editing and prototypes of pop and rock music. His music is a musical adventure and \"modern fairytale\". L&otilde;o has always created his concert shows for both art and music audiences, because \"performability\" is the catchword that gives a Skeletons on Rock set its performance-art quality. Powerful vocals, synthesizers and drums are heard against a background of rousing rhythms. The avant-garde element mixes with pop and a burst of energy is delivered to rock fanatics, hip-hopper, avant-poppers, the electro-chic, as well as high-brow modern art audiences.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now, when the time has arrived for the production of the ultimate \"The Skeletons on Rock Show\", L&otilde;o decided to expand the performance outside the theatre into a media test that goes on for an entire month. Or more smartly worded, into a neo-situationalist media action. L&otilde;o, partially with Kris Lemsalu, places \"The Skeletons on Rock Show\" into the framework of the \"Rock &lsquo;n\' Roll Series\", which included the actions entitled \"Under Wear\" at the Klaxons concert, \"Joint\" at the Tricky concert and \"Tele Vision\" at the Tallinn City Gallery, which were also covered by our media.(See the documentation at robodada.com/andres)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If we were to mock this text with the words of Mart Taniel, \"The complexity that appears when defining act is the art itself, which we do not know how to define\", then despite the difficulties of finding a definition, L&otilde;o\'s actions are emphatically simple in form. It is because of this simplicity that L&otilde;o has decided to construct his artist\'s world around music. Music is ingenuous and simple. Yet, rock and pop music is exciting and unfathomably rich in signs. L&otilde;o examines the \"rock &lsquo;n\' roll effect\" in modern art and music, without differentiating between the two.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>L&otilde;o prepared for the performance-concert at the Nu Performance Festival with photographer Riina Varol. The photo documentation of the show\'s creation and the rock-like social dance of L&otilde;o\'s character will appear on a special website.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Andres L&otilde;o</strong> is an Estonian artist, musician and curator.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/andreslooming\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myspace.com/andreslooming \r\n<hr />\r\n</a>NB!

The aim of this project is to investigate the differences between Estonians and the Russian speaking minority living in Estonia. Using language, cultural background and daily habits the stage will be transformed into a world that symbolizes the transition field between these differences. Three people, all with different background, will be working together, giving and taking impulses and substance from each other. The aim is to involve as much people as possible in the research by sharing ideas, opinions and experiences. The situation proceeds to be neither a competition either a coalition between the different people. After all everything originates from the people\'s mind. With this research, the performance and its process we will question broader behaviour between the different cultures. How much are we controlled by \"unconscious prejudice\" mechanisms in society and our everyday lives? Language and daily habits are parts of our social identity. We think that we understand who our fellow citizens are and how they are really doing... but reality is that most of the time we hardly understand even the simplest cultural differences.<br />How will it end if we try to reconstruct and solve the battle between different backgrounds, norms and values now in 2009? Will this research be only about the difference between Russian-Estonians and Estonians living in Estonia or is it possible to see the similarities with other countries and situations globally.<br /><br /><em>And so it was.

Her work is a convergence of live performance, video installation and narrative film. A male and female dancer create an emotional landscape shaped by the dynamic interplay between closeness and distance, control and powerlessness. Private spheres emerge from which the audience cannot escape - they move throughout an installation that surrounds the performance on all four sides. The traditional stage is replaced by a space in which everyone shares in a common experience.<br />\"private spaces (the p.s. project)\" was created during residencies spent in Tallinn, Newcastle and D&uuml;sseldorf. In her choreography work, Silke Z. intensively examines interpersonal relationships and encounters between performers and audiences. In her last project, \"machMut\", from the 2007 series Mutproben, the performers she worked with included young adults. \"machtMut\" received the 2008 K&ouml;lner Tanz und Theaterpreis (Cologne Dance and Theatre Prize) and was nominated for the 2008 German theatre award DER FAUST. \"private spaces (the p.s. project)\" received also the K&ouml;lner Tanz und Theaterpreis 2008 (Cologne Dance and Theatre Prize)</p>\r\n<p>The line between discomfort and pain has long been crossed as the incredible performer Antonio Cabrita repeatedly hurls himself onto the floor in an attempt to finally illicit a reaction from his self-composed Caroline Simon with his self destruction. For the audience, there is nothing in space separating them from the performers; they are together in the same black enclosure. There is no longer an external world, only mercilessly exposed inner worlds. They want to run. They want to stay.<br />The audience personally experiences the dualism of society\'s need for discretion and curiosity about other people\'s private spheres. At what point is our search for authenticity shameful, when is it truly courageous?<br />In her outstanding production, Silke Z. probes the terror and beauty of intimacy. She has once again succeeded in succinctly capturing a current and indeterminate phenomenon that defies general explanation.<br />Reality, for Silke Z., is bouquet of splinters. Beautiful to behold - but with dangerously sharp edges. <br />Nicole Strecker, K&ouml;lner Tanzpreis award speech</p>\r\n<p>Silke Z. born in 1970, lives and works as an independent choreographer in Cologne. She studied dance and skiing at the Deutsche Sporthochschule K&ouml;ln, completed training at the European Dance Development Center (EDDC) in Arnheim and D&uuml;sseldorf and pursued further training at San Francisco&acute;s Moving On Center - School for Participatory Arts and Research.<br />Silke Z. is a co-founder of resistdance, Studio 11, and die.idee//artist network.<br />Her production, \"fractured\" was honoured with the cologne dance award in 1999 and the F&ouml;rderpreis freier Theater NRW Theaterzwang.

The audience will certainly hear their infamous piece \"Money\" and other well-known and much heard songs.</p>\r\n<p>The repertoire of the duet Kann/Valkep&auml;&auml; consists of very varied pieces. They have been inspired by the old rock legend Mark Lanegan as well as Ali Farka Toure. 2 guitars and an overwhelming voice that will however leave space for physical movement. It will most certainly not leave the audience tepid as the Kann/Valkeap&auml;&auml; duet has received both very positive and very negative responses, they have been loved and hated.

One thing is certain - she enjoys movement and smoky clubs. Kaja Kann has messed around on stage on many more occasions than she would like remembering. And she keeps doing it again and again. Kaja sais that it is enjoyable to wander alone and then discover that she is with Juha and it is especially terrific if the audience is present as well. This is not witty choreography, this is dance.</p>\r\n<p>Already in his early years Juha Valkeap&auml;&auml; (1967) made bizarre sounds to express himself. In his teens he discovered the electric guitar following the pattern of Jimmy Hendrix. Besides this duet he has been part of several folk, punk-rock, alternative sound space and improvisational projects. He likes to take risks.

Everyday actions in close-up on the one hand. And a commentary on commonplace contemporary performance art forms laying bare the way these function and are perceived.</p>\r\n<p>All of this has an aim, a target. He makes use of his own and the audience\'s previous experience and prejudices in having seen grand shows and spectacles. Laying bare their structure and reflecting back the hopes of the audience Kangro leads the spectators into seeing his performance as what it is, not what it is not. For this he uses various types of stage games that lead the spectator into thinking about the paradoxes and forces around how a stage performance is perceived. What he does is a commentary on experience. He leads the audience into awareness of their own perception and finding their own unmediated approach to the work onstage. He makes the spectator realise his preconceptions and hopes, kind of left-over from previously viewed performances. Spectacular episodes exist in his shows but at places where one wouldn\'t expect them.</p>\r\n<p>In his new solo \"Can\'t Get No / Satisfaction\" Mart Kangro will try to investigate how it affects the performer to know that what he does depends directly on the reaction of the audience. That it is only through a certain agreement with the audience that the performer is on stage at all. What compromises are necessary on the part of the performer in order for his artistic idea to be received and to be able to satisfy the audience?</p>\r\n<p>The audience has the justified right to an emotional recharge. On the other hand, the artist has the right to be understood and give to the audience his artistic idea. A conflict? Possibly. Both sides collide and create a paradoxical situation.</p>\r\n<p>Possibly one of the most internationally acclaimed contemporary Estonian choreographers Mart Kangro focuses in his work on the meanings the body and movements create and the concept of meaning in theatre as a semiotic time-space. Kangro has been engaged as a dancer at the Estonian National Opera. As a choreographer he has for a long time collaborated with Christina Ciupke and Thomas Lehmen.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (219,'','<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Isabelle Kirouac</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Isabelle Kirouac is a dancer and physical performer born in Quebec, Canada. Her work draws its inspiration from Contact Improvisation, butoh, performance art, low-tech video, experimental music and northern studies. Imprinted by her studies of improvisation and participatory work, she is interested in minimal dances that speak clearly and cultivate presence and connections. Over the last years, Isabelle has been performing and teaching internationally with The Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theatre, best known for its acrobatic stilt dramas, and Body Research, a company crossing the boundaries between theatre, dance, and self-exploration, using the disciplined study of Contact Improvisation as one of its main tools. She participated to numerous festivals, such as the Forum International de Las Culturas de Monterrey (Mexico), The Edinburgh Fringe Festival (Scotland), Danse Encore (Canada)(...), and collaborated with Diodramas (Quebec), Superamas (France/Austria), Flam Chen (Arizona), Rumblepeg (California), Felix Ruckert (Berlin), film/installation artists Daichi Saito and Karl Lemieux (Double Negative Collective, Montreal), and the percussionist Chris Cogburn (No Idea Festival, Texas).<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project description</span><br />The Cryonic Woman is a poetic performance installation exploring the quest of immortality of a Northern woman and pushing the boundaries between real and imagined. As to be remembered, to become immortal, projected images and personal information about us multiply online. Imprinting memories as a way to defeat our ephemeral nature, fame slowly replaces religion. Blurring the lines between real and imagined, which layers of us can still be us? \"If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.\" The Cryonic Woman represents the plenitude and the solitude of the North: \"Everywhere, a huge nowhere.\" In this landscape, we are looking further than ourselves, into ourselves and out of ourselves, to find what we are missing, what we can only find in extreme solitude. The Cryonic Woman has been created in Montreal (Canada) in 2009, with the collaboration of 2boys.tv, OBORO New Media Lab and Studio 303. This multimedia performance integrates live performance, sounds, objects and video-projections.<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rebecca Pappas</strong><br />Biography</span><br />From 1997 to 2001 Rebecca Pappas attended Connecticut College where she studied dance under Dan Wagoner and Jeremy Nelson. Upon graduation Pappas moved to Oakland, CA where she began choreographing under the name Pappas and Dancers. There she created 12 original works and was presented at venues including The Yerba Buena Gardens, ODC Theater, The Cowell Theater, and Theater Artaud. Her company also appeared in the Monterey Dance Festival, Westwave/Summerfest, The Underserved at ODC, The Yerba Buena Gardens Festival, and twice at the Women on the Way Festival. During this time she developed a style whose hallmark was delicate, self-contained movement worlds and idiosyncratic gesture. Since moving to Los Angeles in 2006, she has been well-received by critics and audiences alike, and Sara Wolf of the Los Angeles Times recently referred to her work as \"mesmerizing\" and \"compelling.\" Iterations of Monster have been presented in California, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New York at venues including The Contemporary Jewish Museum, Connecticut College, and Movement Research at Judson Church. Monster is reflective of P and D\'s interest in approaching the body as an archive for physical and social histories. In researching Monster Pappas traveled to Tel Aviv where she served as Barak Marshall\'s choreographic assistant during the Bridge Choreographic Dialogues Program. In addition she has been a rehearsal assistant for Melanie Rios Glazer at the Wooden Floor and has performed for artists including Victoria Marks, Alma Esperanza Cunningham, Rachael Lincoln, and Erica Shuch. Pappas\' work has received choreographic residencies at Yaddo, Dragon\'s Egg and Shotwell Studios, and funding from the Clorox Company Foundation, the Zellerbach Family Foundation, and the Mellon Committee for Research on the Holocaust in American and World Culture.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Rebecca Pappas will present \"Thumbnail,\" a solo excerpt from Monster. Monster, a quartet that excavates the corporeal legacy of the Holocaust and explores the way history is layered onto the contemporary Jewish body in Diaspora. The piece begins with an invocation of names and gestures meant to perform \"The Holocaust Effect,\" Ernst van Alphen\'s theory that certain tropes: lists of name, catalogs of faces, train tracks etc. will inevitably remind viewers of the Holocaust. From there it goes on to look at how memorial culture, historical memory, and cultural trauma are accumulated on and form the Jewish body or that of any \"victimized\" group. In the piece the dancer\'s bodies are constantly shape shifting- alternately becoming monsters, memorializers, victims and victimizers as they try on various physicalities. Monster is a danced intervention within an official \"Jewish history\" that draws a straight line of justification between the devastation of the Holocaust and the brutality of Israel and a clear delineation between the victims and the victimizers. Pappas will also present a performed paper that traces the development of the piece and its historical and artistic source material. This lecture contextualizes the work and examines other works by artists grappling with the contemporary legacy of the Holocaust, Jewish history, and the body including Adi Ness and Christian Boltanski.<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cid Pearlman</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Cid Pearlman is currently a Fulbright Scholar (academic year 2009- 2010), teaching at Tallinn University and collaborating with Estonian dance artists. Her work has been presented by numerous venues including Joyce SoHo (New York City), the Getty Center (Los Angeles), Theater Artaud (San Francisco) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (San Diego). From 1991-1999 she was the artistic director of San Francisco\'s critically acclaimed Nesting Dolls. In 1999 Pearlman relocated to Los Angeles, establishing herself as an independent choreographer and producer. Her most recent collaborations have been with composers Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of Kronos Quartet, and Jonathan Segel of Camper Van Beethoven. In addition to her own works, Pearlman has choreographed for film, opera and theater. Her evening length dance, \"High Fall,\" won the 2002 Lester Horton Award for Visual Design, and 2006\'s \"small variations,\" was nominated for two Horton Awards. Pearlman received both her BA in World Arts and Cultures, and her Master of Fine Arts degree in Dance from the University of California, Los Angeles. After completing her graduate studies, she moved to Santa Cruz, California in 2006, and teaches in the Dance Department at Cabrillo College. Her work has received support from the Djerassi Resident Artist Program, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the San Francisco Art Commission, the Zellerbach Family Fund, the Walter and Elise Haas Fund, the American Composers Forum and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. Pearlman will premiere the works she is creating with Estonian dancers at Kanuti Gildi Saal, 25-26 May and at NOTAFE 12-17 July.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Cid Pearlman will present excerpts from \"This is what we do in winter\" and \"catch-as-catchcan.\" The first work is a quintet, which was created during Pearlman\'s Fulbright year in Estonia. The second work was developed in 2006 with dancers from Los Angeles, and will be performed by 3rd year BA students from the Choreography Department at Tallinn University. Pearlman will also present a paper on her approach to choreographing difference in 2006\'s \"small variations.\"<br /> <strong><br /></strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rain Saukas &amp; Alexis Steeves</strong><br />Biographies</span><br />Rain Saukas is a professional dancer and graphic designer based in Tallinn.

Here is the raw beginning of serious play which aims to unwind and portray assumptions, expectations, negotiations and authentic<br />connections. The sound score anchoring this premiere collaboration was created from the original soundtrack of James Ivory\'s film \"A Room with a View\". A close adaptation of E.M. Forster\'s title novel which narrates cultural clashes of gender, class and even \"the things of the universe\" with critical humor.<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Fine 5</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Tiina Ollesk &amp; Rene N&otilde;mmik - Fine 5 Dance Theatre (www.fine5.ee) is one of the bestknown and the most influential independent contemporary dance companies in Estonia. It<br />was founded in 1992 when five dancers from \"Nordstar\" dance theatre formed their own group. In early 90-ies their work was influenced by traditional modern dance techniques, since the end of 90-ies the working methods have changed, combining various approaches to human movement and dance as an art. Since 1997, the key figures of the theatre have been Rene N&otilde;mmik and Tiina Ollesk.<br />Fine 5 has worked with many respected choreographers including Tommi Kitti (Finland), Matteo Moles (Belgium) etc. Fine 5 is the laureate of several international dance contests and festivals. The company has performed in USA, France, Italy, Sweden, Cyprus, Finland, Poland, Baltic States, Russia and Belorussia. The company has successfully performed at the internationally well-known Birgitta Festival in Tallinn, Estonia. Their choreography for C.Orff \"Carmina Burana\" (in the program since 2005) will be presented again in Birgitta 2010. In 2003 Fine 5 received the Philip Morris Dance Award in Estonia; in 2009, the Estonian Theater Award in the Dance productions category for \"PHASES\" \"an enriching dialogue between live music and choreography, artistically convincing presentation of a topical subject and continuity in developing its own style and training new generations.\" A former actress, and Associate Professor at Estonian Music and Theater Academy, Maret Mursa graduated from the Alexander Technique Institute of Finland (MSTAT, 1999), working on the doctoral thesis \"The use of conscious inhibition in the work of a performing artist.\"<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Excerpt from \"4 vaadet\" (work in progress)<br />Once again, after 20 years of practice as dancers, choreographers and teachers we took time to research what we do and why we do it. How lived lives and gathered experience helps (or doesn\'t) to motivate doing it and sharing it. In the final version of the piece (premier October 2010) we will reflect on the issues of a \"live\" dance and identity exploring four different ideas - identities in the same frame of set choreography - to create new and different \"live\" journeys every time.<br />We see creating a new work as a journey with or without audience. This journey explores the grey area between clear images and bodily action, physicality and emotion in partnership and vulnerability. Today the &lsquo;live\" aspect has almost become an obsession, there are many illusions of simultaneous encounters with the outside world. Digitalization of everyday life and communication creates a longing for the \"real,\" the unique event that happens only once, and is live..<br /> <strong><br /></strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Elo Unt</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Elo Unt graduated from the choreography department of the University of Tallinn. She works in E.T.A. Dance School as dance teacher and choreographer since 2003. She has created short numbers and dance productions in quantities that have also reached the School Dance Festival\'s Final Concert every year, and merited special prizes as well as two Laureate titles. Elo\'s choreographical language is contemporary but recognizably Estonian, very dynamic and musical and her productions are always crowned with a humorous point. The current performance is Elo\'s first full-length dance performance.<br />Estonian Dance Agency Dance School is for children and young aged 4-25 years. Altogether<br />more than 400 pupils study at our school annually. The school\'s preparatory stage is the Kaie K&otilde;rb Ballet Studio where children aged 4-11 years study (main subjects being classical dance, acrobatics, rythmics, creative dance and contemporary dance). The ballet studio was established in 1999.<br />The main stage at school is E.T.A. Studio that was established in autumn 2004 with the goal of training young dancers aged 12-18 with a versatile dance technique during the six-year-long study period and who have the wish to continue studying dance at higher education institutions. Study is based on classical, contemporary and jazz dance techniques. In addition to offering professional dance education, Estonian Dance Agency Dance School has taken upon its mission to ensure dancers with outputs such as various dance projects and concerts that would bring more pupils to develop their physical and creative capabilities through the techniques of the art of dance. Youth group Twister was established in spring 2007 and the Youth Dance Theatre in spring 2009.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Dance performance &bdquo;ESTONIANS\' FOUR O-s\"- Otsides (Looking), Oodates (Waiting), Olles (Being) and Ohkides (Moaning)...\"<br />Idea and story: Elo Unt and Kristjan Kurm<br />Direction, choreography and costumes: Elo Unt<br />Performers: Mirjam Luhakooder, Siim Adamson, Liisa Laine, Greta Raidma, Anne&Ouml;&ouml;sike Niit, Ingmar J&otilde;ela<br />Music mix and sound effects: K&uuml;lli T&uuml;li<br />Production: Jane Miller-P&auml;rnam&auml;gi<br />Performance makes use of music by authors: Mari Kalkun, Paabel, Ursula<br />Premiere: August 7, 2009 in Kingston, Jamaica<br />Duration: 30 min<br />Otsides - looking for something, Oodates - waiting for somebody, wanting to be - Olla - somebody and thus Ohkides - moaning through life - from day to day, from evening to morning, from yesterday to today, from today to tomorrow, from tomorrow to the day after, etc.<br />This is a story about us, it is Estonian through and through. You wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and you see an Estonian. You go to bed in the evening, wake up the next day, look in the mirror again - nothing has changed. In the meantime, you take a sauna, scrub the dirt off and put on foreign clothes but the mirror still shows the same Estonian - you take a deep breath, moan and again tomorrow you will try to change something that is unchangeable. The performance tries to decipher the essence of an Estonian, portraying his genetical complexes and behaviors. Four O-s or O4 would be like the genetic formula of the essence of an Estonian. An Estonian is a workaholic, a party animal who has no sense of moderation in anything. Therefore, an Estonian is unable to love or feel joy and is constantly thriving towards obtaining things that are newer and brighter - it\'s never enough, it\'s never good enough. As if spending the whole life looking for something that does not exist, or wanting to be somebody who you are not able to be. That\'s why all of our mornings are &bdquo;blue Mondays\" regardless the century we are living in. Nevertheless, an Estonian is quite a sweet creature who, at the end of the day, still crawls into his cave and settles down. Even if the cave is small, it is his own and that\'s what is important. The performance has been put together in summer 2009 during the time of the jubilee Song and Dance Celebration. The performance is an expansion of the short number &bdquo;Puu taga...\" (Behind the tree...) which brought the E.T.A. Dance Studio the Laureate title at the School Dance Festival 2009 (Koolitants in origin) in the contemporary dance category. The performance\'s initial version premiered on August 7, 2009 in Kingston, Jamaica, in the frames of the international dance conference where it received a storming applause. In conclusion, a short quote from Postimees daily by Mihkel Mutt (literary critic) that was published on July 15, 2009, around the time that the performance was being finalized: &bdquo;We are no tough free lords or bourgeois of the tenth generation, no romantic knights or great pirates who some of us have started to identify as in the meantime;, we are valets and saloon-keepers, parish clerks at best. We are the people whose inner backbone and greatest treasure is to come together after a long days work, blow the horn and sing, and thus cleanse and steel oneself.\"<br />Good luck in looking in the mirror!<br />Kristjan Kurm<br />(director of Estonian Dance Agency)</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Symposion timetable: <a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/203/?lng=en\" target=\"_self\">http://www.saal.ee/event/203/?lng=en</a><br />Organized by: Tallinn University Institute of Fine Arts Department of Choreography<br />Where: Tallinn University Institute of Fine Arts / Lai 13 &amp; Kanuti Gildi SAAL / Pikk 20<br />Conference registration: Thursday, 13 May, 10:00am - 12:00pm, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, Pikk 20, Tallinn<br />More info and pre-registrations: Heili Einasto heiein@tlu.ee or Cid Pearlman<br />Photo: cid.pearlman@fulbrightmail.org L.Wu<br />Supporters: Cultural Endowment of Estonia, Tallinn University, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, U.S. Embassy in Tallinn<br />Entrance:<br />Fee: 300.- for all three days, including all seminars and performances upon pre-registration<br />Performance nights 13+14.04: 100.- per evening available at Piletilevi<br />Student works 14.04: 25.- available half an hour before at the door.</p>',1,'','<p>Tallinn University Institute of Fine Arts Department of Choreography symposion Performance night:</p>\r\n<p class=\"keskmine\">ISABELLE KIROUAC, REBECCA PAPPAS, CID PEARLMAN, ALEXIS STEEVES, FINE5, ELO UNT</p>');

Her work is grounded both in the symbiotic relationship between process and product and in her collaborations with other artists.<br />A 2009 recipient of a Hothouse residency at UCLA and a 2007 recipient of a Silo Residency from DanceNOW/NYC, Rebecca has had her work produced in a variety of festivals and venues in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco including Deli Dances at Times Square, estrogenius at Manhattan Theatre Source, University Settlement, Access Theater, Highways Performance Space, Anatomy Riot, Under the Radar at High Energy Constructs, Studio at REDCAT and STREAM/fest at CounterPULSE. Rebecca has performed in works by Stephan Koplowitz, Yvonne Rainer, Denise Uyehara, Taisha Paggett, Carol McDowell, Cid Pearlman and Ana Maria Alvarez. Her bodywork, dancing and choreography are deeply influenced by her continuing studies with Barbara Mahler. She holds a B.A. in Dance and Sociology from Wesleyan University and an M.F.A. in Dance and Choreography from UCLA.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />The Surveillance Solos employ a combination of farce and stark honesty to question, in a world where so much information is easily accessible, just what can be considered private or intimate, and how quickly small deviations from \"normal\" behavior become suspicious. This excerpt, Surveillance Solo No. 4: Christine Suarez, imagines surveillance invading the innermost circle of privacy, positioning Christine\'s ex-husband as informant. As the male informant/agent reports on the mundane actions of Christine\'s morning routine, she moves in an ever-tightening spiral around him, performing folk-dance footwork and functional gestures. When she is out of the house, she inhabits a broader range of movement punctuated by her own internal rhythms and teeming emotion. Her actions are reported upon by a female agent who comes to identify with her subject\'s movements even as she informs on them. Christine\'s dancing through a projected profile alternately emphasizes and disappears pieces of her biography.<br /><br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sandra Chatterjee</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Cultivating an aesthetic that reflects the nomadic qualities of her life, Dr. (ucla) Sandra Chatterjee combines her interests of choreographing, writing, and organizing arts-related events/platforms. Sandra holds a PhD in Culture &amp; Performance (University of California, Los Angeles - UCLA), where she also taught as a visiting scholar. She also completed a diploma in \"Kultur und Organisation\" in Vienna. She is a cofounder of the Post Natyam Collective, a transnational network of independent choreographers/scholars, working in body based performance, video, and scholarship. In her scholarship, which has most recently been presented at \"Re-Searching Dance: International Conference on Dance Research\" (World Dance Alliance Asia/Pacific) in New Delhi and by ALF/CSCS, Bangalore (2009), she continually strives to intersect research, theorization and artistic practice. Sandra\'s training in Kuchipudi provides a foundation from which to create choreography, also drawing on her training in Bharatanatyam, Polynesian dance, modern/postmodern dance, and yoga. She received the Hawaii State dance Council\'s Choreographic Award and Cultural Preservation Award. Her professional experience includes solo performances in classical Indian dance as well as contemporary performance. She has, among others, worked with choreographers and artists Liz Lerman, Pichet Klunchun, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, and collaborated with Eko Supriyanto (Indonesia), Aditee Biswas (India), P.Senthilkumar (Austria). Her work (collaborative and solo) has been performed in Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic and India, e.g. at the prestigious THE OTHER FESTIVAL, Adhyaya and NATYA/STEM, Bangalore, at Neues Haus der Kammerspiele and Theatron, Munich, at Chandra-Mandapa-Spaces, Chennai, at V&ouml;lkerkunde Museum, Vienna, and at Tanzhaus NRW, D&uuml;sseldorf.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Using one dancer\'s body, video-projections, fragments of narrations and snap shots of the body, Self-portrait as Exotic releases female identity into fragments of movement and video, critically reflecting an exotifying gaze. Through a collage of video-projections, shadows, and varied movements vocabularies, tensions and oppositions, such as live-projected, south asian-european, viewer-viewed, will be played with. Self-portrait as Exotic has the choreographer/performer\'s experience as an \"Indian dancer\" of Bengali-German origin, living and dancing in Munich as a starting point. However, the piece unfolds as a coming together of fragments of stories, literature as well as autobiographical anecdotes. The presentation will be a coming together of speaking from the choreographic process, theorizing themes, and performing work-in-progress excerpts of movement, projection and text.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hana van der Kolk</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Hana van der Kolk was New York based (2001-2005) and Los Angeles-based (2005-2010) and is currently transient.

Featuring music/text by Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam, Prince, Daft Punk and others, Once More draws from aspects of popular American (and global) culture to evoke familiar, even clich&eacute; narratives, while formal investigations of duration and repetition play with and against these clich&eacute; to examine intimacy, presence, and the cultivation and sharing of joy.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ana Flecha</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Ana Flecha has been presenting work for over a decade, recently receiving support from Dancer\'s Group and Theatre Bay Area, and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. Ana was the 2008 Artist in Residence at the Four Eighteen Project in Santa Cruz where she presented My American Dream, a multi media dance theater piece about American culture and identity. In the Spring of 2009 Ana performed with Kevin O\'Connor in his piece The Sunlight Zone, in California and Ontario, Canada, and she recently presented material from a new collaboration titled Anas in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

In March 2010 she co-directed the first Nomadic College month long training intensive based in the Axis Syllabus in Canoa Quebrada, Brazil, as well as teaching in Rio de Janeiro and Natal. Ana attended Tisch School of the Arts for dance at New York University, receiving her bachelors degree in 1995, and spent four years as part of the Chelsea Repertory LAB Company after graduation, performing and creating new work.</p>\r\n<p>Project Description<br />The Red Queen, a multi-media solo originally excerpted from the evening length piece My American Dream, reflects on the mask of busy-ness in the lives of modern Americans. The woman in this piece is engaged in an ongoing race against time by the multi-tasking trappings of her daily schedule, which leaves her exactly where she started. Her metered drive is endlessly bracketed by the natural rhythms that govern the environment beyond her cubicle. The title of this piece is borrowed from the evolutionary theory that there is change but not necessarily progress, that progress is an invitation for defeat, and that existence does not get any easier. Evolutionists borrowed this term from the Red Queen in Alice and the Looking Glass, who runs like the wind but never gets anywhere.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tee Kuubis</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Tee Kuubis (Tea/Do Cube) was created in spring 2005 by the students, teachers and alumni of the Department of Choreography, Tallinn University. The theatre helps to produce the performances of its members to show in public, offers technical support and searches for co-operations to have fresh experiences and processes. We have produced several dance performances mainly in contemporary dance, Estonian folk and stage dances (2/3 of our performances), medieval and renaissance dances. We are especially known for our site-specific thinking - we concentrate on space and time of every performance and try to \"feel\" the context. For site-specific projects the theatre was awarded the prize of the Breakthrough 2006 at Philip Morris Estonian Modern Dance Award distribution on 29 April 2006. Now already for more than 5 years tens of different projects/pieces and about 600 performing experiences have been organized and brought to the public. Theatre works on a project bases and has had the cooperation with Tallinn University, Estonian Concert, Estonian Open Air Museum, Historical music band Rondellus, Estonian Academy of Arts, Tallinn Art House, Enterprise Estonia, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, E-Theatre, Tallinn City Council and many other local institutions. Our members have been in the directing team of the big Estonian Dance Celebration already from the year 2004.

We do not think we are cold, sad and hurt. But we really are a bit ignorant. Is it because our reality is different and we still have too much work to do for our own homes? Or because we are used to survive? Or because we are lazy to analyze? Or because we are \"kilplased\" in our origin?

August DanceFestival has never been afraid of breaking the stereotypes, even if this requires force. The festival in this year in this sense is no exception - the invited artists dismantle the borders of dance art as well as border in between different art forms by sneaking, outmanoeuvring, pressurizing or dancing. The aim of it is to make the spectators wander, enjoy, hate and contemplate at the performances presented in the theatres and on the streets of Tallinn.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">August DanceFestival 2011 ticket sales opens on June 15 offering:</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">-single tickets on sale with price 5/8 EUR available until 07.08 and starting from 08.08 with full price 8/11 EUR at Piletimaailm&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.piletimaailm.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">www.piletimaailm.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp; and Piletilevi&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.piletilevi.ee\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">www.piletilevi.ee</span></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">-limited number of FESTIVAL PASSPORTS, with price 25/50 EUR, providing access to all performances of the festival are on sale at Piletilevi until August 8</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">-limited number of FESTIVAL SMALL PASSPORTS, with price 15/24 EUR, providing access to 4 chosen performances of the festival (have to be chosen at the box-offices) are on sale at the box-offices of Piletilevi until August 8</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">*Concession is valid for students and retired people upon presenting relevant document at the door.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">August DanceFestival 2011 program:</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">15.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">GUNILLA H\r\n<script src=\"http://www.saal.ee/ohjur/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\nEILBORN</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;/Stockholm/:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">This Is Not A Love Story</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">16.08 / 20:00 Amphitheatre of the Estonian National Library</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">MIHKEL ERNITS &amp; LAURA KVELSTEIN</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;/Tallinn/:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">It was good while it lasted</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;(feat.

Since 2004 every second year the festival is devoted to emerging young artist and their work.</p>\r\n<p><br />First August DanceFestival was held in 1999 in Tallinn, but it is a continuation of summer festival idea started in 1996 in P&auml;rnu, Estonia. The festival is taking place mainly at the Kanuti Gildi SAAL, but other venues are used as well.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (232,'','<p>The choreographer Hooman Sharifi, of Iranian descent, tells of a country in which time has no special meaning. This is a country which has not happened yet, but yet it seems that it has always already been there. A country which still has to come, however it has already come long time ago. Because time is in abundance in this country, living together is experienced as a plurality of possible ways how people are coming into being. Since one is always exposed to the plurality of possible actions, people can live together in constant disagreement, but nevertheless they could also allow a problem to exist for such a long time that the best solution will appear. In this country of endless possibilities, the encounters between its inhabitants take place because of their radical refusal of any change. The performance explores the embodied relations of this imaginative land with plenty of time and the ways how distribution of bodies refuse change to make life possible. With that possibilities are created for the audience to imagine what would be the country with the plentitude of time, where movement is not depending exclusively on change.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hooman Sharifi\'s works are of tremendous physical power. As spontaneous as they sometimes appear to be, their intensity is the result of meticulous consideration and choreography, a movement between theatre, dance and visual art. For Sharifi, like hardly any other contemporary choreographer, the motto is \"art is politics\" - and politics, to him, means social perception and commitment not by means of superficial analysis or easy-to-read representation of supposedly political topics. Instead he goes deeper, searching for the emotions and structures behind group hierarchies, violence, power and abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Born and raised in Iran, <strong>Hooman Sharifi</strong> is now a Norwegian Citizen. He arrived in Norway solitarily in 1989 at the age of 15. His experience in dance started with hip-hop and street-jazz. Later, at the age of 21, came the technical training of classical ballet and modern dance. In 1997 he was accepted to the 3-year course in choreography with the National College of Ballet and Dance in Oslo, from which he graduated in spring 2000. He has always had an interest in the \"cross-work\" of dance and theatre, and after graduating he has worked with dramatic as well as visual art. In 2000 he established Impure Company. The statement \"art equals politics\" where social awareness and commitment defines the word politics marks the outset for Impure Company and signifies what art is and should be. Hooman Sharifi has been successfully invited to theatres and festivals in Estonia for several years.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Choreography, direction and light:<strong> Hooman Sharifi</strong><br />Made and performed by: <strong>Rikke Baewert, Matthew William Smith, Loan Ha, Martin Lervik, Peder Horgen</strong><br />Artistic collaborator: <strong>Bojana Kunst</strong><br />Text: <strong>Daniel Franco and Hooman Sharifi</strong><br />Music: <strong>coh</strong><br />Tailor: Dylvia R.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (233,'','<p>This is a new open-air version of the piece \"Bodysnatchers\" by Mihkel Ernits, a young Estonian choreographer that premiered in January on the stage of Kanuti Gildi SAAL.</p>\r\n<p><br />This visually nifty performance takes place in a scaffolding cage and can be seen on Freedom Square and on the square of Lindakivi Cultural Centre. Choreography is physical using acrobatic techniques, sometimes even dangerous - challenging the abilities of dancers. Performed by some of the most technical Estonian dancers - Rain Saukas, Laure Kvelstein, J&ouml;rgen Kapp and K&uuml;lli Roosna. Scaffolding cage hence plays the role of broadening the notion of stagespace.</p>\r\n<p><br />\"Bodysnatchers\" takes the spectators into a parallel world with its surreal characters, scaffolding cage and fanciful story. Rules and etiquette there are a mixture of that what we know of combined with overturned reality to make one think about the patterns of behaviour and rules of society. This surreal world provides young artists with a chance to test the themes that are on their minds playfully through distorting-mirror.</p>\r\n<p><br />Suitable for the whole family, but do not try this at home!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bodysnatchers:<br />1. Bodysnachers as tomb-breakers and organ brokers have contributed into the development of medicine throughout the history. Currently we can find examples from Thailand, Palestine and elsewhere where corpses are stolen and sold on black market.<br />2. \"The Body Snachers\" is a film based on Jack Finney science-fiction novel (1955) which describes a town in California, being invaded by seeds that have drifted to Earth from space. The seeds replace sleeping people with perfect physical duplicates. This novel has been screened 4 times and the on made in 1978 is associated with anti-communism motives (the identical ideal copies of humans as the perfect members of downright reglemented society, sowing the seeds of communism, etc).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mihkel Ernits</strong> is a freelance choreographer and currently he is obtaining MA degree in choreographer - director studies at Tallinn University Institute of Fine Arts Department of Choreography.

Choreography is physical using acrobatic techniques,  sometimes even dangerous - challenging the abilities of dancers.  Performed by some of the most technical Estonian dancers - Rain Saukas,  Laure Kvelstein, J&ouml;rgen Kapp and K&uuml;lli Roosna. Scaffolding cage hence  plays the role of broadening the notion of stagespace.</p>\r\n<p><br />\"Bodysnatchers\" takes the spectators into a parallel world with  its surreal characters, scaffolding cage and fanciful story. Rules and  etiquette there are a mixture of that what we know of combined with  overturned reality to make one think about the patterns of behaviour and  rules of society. This surreal world provides young artists with a  chance to test the themes that are on their minds playfully through  distorting-mirror.</p>\r\n<p><br />Suitable for the whole family, but do not try this at home!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bodysnatchers:<br />1. Bodysnachers as tomb-breakers and organ brokers  have contributed into the development of medicine throughout the  history.

The seeds replace sleeping people  with perfect physical duplicates.

Her original and research based works have caught attention over the world. \"Quartet for a Microphone\" is a real time sound and choreographic installation inspired by a phone booth stanging on stage. This work sets a discourse about confinement, the lack of distance, the relation with the other and about the idea of being hostages of our own existence. Being a real time composition the only reference and support is set on the visible/audible situation that is constant during 60 minutes. Every idea -sort of starting-point keywords- come into conjunction with the movement of sound, with the glance of the audience and this is how other new and unexpected ideas are born.

Finally, they are revealing their so far strictly confidential relationships with two famous characters of the European and Russian art scene: French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard as the intellectual super-father from the West and the flagship prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, highly appreciated by the Soviet regime, play essential roles. Andrianov and Soulimenko reflect on their ever-changing artistic and personal development through songs, stories and styles of dancing. Post-communist war battle of eastern and western cultural clich&eacute;s.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1993 Russian dancer Andrei Andrianov and choreographer Oleg Soulimenko founded a dance-performance duo under the name of Saira Blanche Theatre. The duo performed on various festivals in the cities of Vienna, Moscow, Amsterdam, Berlin, New York, Yaroslavl, Yekaterinburg, Greifswald, Potsdam, Stockholm, Brunswick, Tallinn and many more. After a longer lasting break, Andrei Andrianov and Oleg Soulimenko resumed their collaborative work in May 2007.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Andrei Andrianov </strong>is a dancer, choreographer and teacher. He began his career in 1979 at Gedrus Mackjavichus\' Modern Dance and Mime Theatre in Moscow. He learned modern dance, pantomime, improvisation, martial arts and acting. Later on in Europe he also studied contact improvisation, BMC, release techniques and performance art. In 1993, together with Oleg Soulimenko, Andrianov created the dance-performance duo for Saira Blanche Theatre. From 1996 to 2000 he was regularly collaborating with the Vienna-based performance ensemble Lux Flux. In 2001, Andrianov was engaged as a dancer by the newly founded company Do-Dance at the Moscow Theatre School of Dramatic Art. In 2003, he was the choreographer in residence at Vienna\'s Tanzquartier Wien where he presented a new solo for the \"Factory Season\". In April 2008, the piece \"Burnashev &amp; Andrianov (live)\" premiered in Moscow under his direction.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Oleg Soulimenko</strong> is a Russian performer and choreographer living and working in Vienna. In 1985, he graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University with a degree in construction engineering and decided to become a dancer. In 1991, he founded the Saira Blanche Theatre, developing a sophisticated and provocative form of dance improvisation. Soulimenko has collaborated with artists like Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson, Markus Schinwald, Meg Stuart &amp; Damaged Goods, Lebbeus Woods, and Jennifer Lacey. His latest performances were presented in eastern and western Europe, in the USA, in Canada, in Israel, at the Tanzquartier and at brut theatre in Vienna, at Performa 07 in New York, at steirischer herbst in Graz, at Tangente in Montreal, at Cankarjev Dom in Ljubljana, at the Dostoyevsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, at the Jerusalem Gerard bercher Center, at the Kunstverein Hannover, at the MAK - Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna, at the Lentos Arts Museum in Linz, and at the Kunsthalle Wien.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Maya Plisetskaya</strong>, born in 1925 in Moscow, descends from a Russian family with a long ballet tradition, her uncle being a legendary ballet instructor, her aunt a prima ballerina at the Bolshoi. Her teenage years were shaped by the Stalinist purges with her father disappearing without a trace in 1937. \"The Dying Swan\" became her calling card: more than twenty thousand times did she dance \"her\" role. She embodied all classical main parts like the Laurentia in the eponymous ballet by Krejn, as well as the Juliet in \"Romeo and Juliet\".

When in 1951 Andr&eacute; Bazin founded the critical magazine Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, Godard was among its first authors. He is known as the most innovative, most productive and most debated director of the \"Nouvelle Vague\". In his films, Godard does not mirror, but cite and assemble reality and applies himself self-reflectively and against all conventions of classical narrative cinema.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (243,'','<p>Dobro do&scaron;li! / Welcome!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A year ago two young artists were chosen to present their country in a competitive European theatre world. They bravely answered this challenge, creating a masterpiece of modern theatre called \"Geography victims\". But their journey was plagued by misfortune, misunderstanding and other hardships. They were banned, they were censored. But now they&acute;re back! With a new concept. And there are three of them. Triple the size, triple the adventure. Their goal - to present their homeland in the best possible way - \"Geography victims 2 - the return of the victim\".<br />This is their story...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2011 Croatia is supposed to become a member of the EU. Miran Kurspahi&#263; and Rona ?ulj have had their project named \'Geography Victims\' as to refer, in this theatrical experience, especially on geographical, geopolitical, political, sociological, socio-political and even completely private aspects of being and living in a pre-European homeland of theirs. Such theme, oriented at the first sight narrowly inter-theatrically, becomes widened in its relevancy as the issues and thinking become more openly applicable, questioning the problems of micro politics and politics of art, private mechanisms of doing and reflection of these mechanisms in one\'s artistic actions, creation of private, author\'s and stage identities, presentation of an identity before the other and by the other, questions of belonging and a will to come out, to present.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miran Kurspahi&#263;</strong>, an enfant terrible of the Croatian there scene is always willing to act without hesitation or any limitations. His pathological need to ironize every person and every event in his immediate and distant surroundings usually results in a determined self-irony. He loves cats as well as spirits. Especially Croatian schnapps called &Scaron;ljivovica. He constantly emphasizes that anger is the main impulse for his artistic, social and athletic activities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rona ?ulj</strong> gives 30% of herself 80% of the time. She has as aversion to direct confrontations and actions that are not necessary, but she is still always prepared to defend herself and, form a half autistic position, to launch criticism, which guarantees that lively discussion will not take place. At the same time she makes sure that her attitude, artistic as well as personal, is indisputable. She loves horses and pretentious words such as \"aloofness\". Her perfect complexion is a result of using olive oil from the Island of Hvar.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sven Jakir</strong> is an academic actor. Sweet, honest, blonde, blonder than Sweden, Jakir often plays smart and emphasizes that playing smart is better than playing pretty which obviously refers to Kurspahi&#263;s lifestyle. Also, he is the biggest victim, bigger than the other five. Imagine (or look at the picture) how its like to be a Balcanian in heart and Sweden in appearance. Svens outside do not fit. Inappropriate balcanian wit is his only survival kit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dean Kriva&#269;i&#263;</strong> is very professional in what he is doing. As an actor he is a three time award winner. His best qualities are loyalty and Christianity. Although a gypsy in his heart, in 1992 he converted to Catholicism and since then is mostly seen in church. Besides the almighty he loves football and his gorgeous Argentinian catholic wife Renata. Every night before sleep he brunches with Dalmatian prosciutto, oven baked bread and a few or more glasses of domestic black wine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vanja Vascarac</strong> is a fully-fledged member of Generation X and a gentle cynic living in a world that swings between harsh naivety and cruel paranoia.

Dean Kriva&#269;i&#263;, Sven Jakir and Miran Kurspahi&#263; are on the stage talking about their work and questioning themselves about the best way to represent Croatia. In the well known Kurspahi&#263; method of activating the auditorium, the audience was given a role of international producers (all of us got a calling card of the actors), and provoked about their questionable sexuality and nationality (we all know that gays and jews rock the theatre world). The final scene emphasizes the form of a political cabaret; Dean Kriva&#269;i&#263; sings Danke Dautschland, dressed in both Croatian and German flag. There is a glove hanging from his behind. And guess what sign is on the glove. The yellow European stars.<br />Iva Grui&#263;, Jutarnji list</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kurspahi&#263; &amp; ?ulj successfully developed a selfironizing, provocative but also very manipulative performance with lots of parody. Geography victims is a witty and delightful patchwork formed in mildly Monty Python style, a story about Croatia and her European future...<br />Helena Braut, Vjesnik</p>\r\n<p><br />Geography victims - a commercial. Though not for Croatia but for authors themselves... Whie actors on stage try to sell themselves to the audience, the main objectives comes to the surface; from the concrete ones like geographical position, well known tourist locations, gastronomic menu etc actors lead us all the way to fully understanding Balcanian mentality; true emotions are introduced and revealed through singing and dancing. Structurally, performance is consisted of numerous closed episodes dealing with theatrical and metatheatrical inquestioning of the theatre act itself. Actors test different methods of acting and actions on the stage; they use classic narration, story telling, mine and many more. The content of the episodes goes from strictly informational to some very playful and humorous demonstrations, like the one of Croatian folklore followed by great video presentation of literature used for making the scene. In this highly physical performance, actors are crossing the borders of the stage and mingle with the public offering them cheese and ham, Croatian &scaron;ljivovica and are in constant search for a producer. Behind all of the humour and wittiness, and the end, lies the truth about our preeuropean reality and a very well formed critique of political and social bearers of the country. I think I can predict a good box office result to Geography victims.<br />Igor Tretinjak</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A junction of stand up comedy and pure ritual pleasure, a good form for presenting domestic mentality. Kurspahi&#263; and ?ulj are playing with the clich&eacute;, presenting the beautiness of Croatian shore and Balkan excitement while singing, shouting and shooting, they are opening important questions about Croatia as a part of the European Union. Kurspahi&#263; is, as always, slightly auto-ironic when in search for a better \"European\" producer. Well, judging by the number of his work that Theatre &amp;TD produced through past seasons, it seems that he has found one. Fortunately for the Croatian theatre scene which screams for diversity. Even if it was a bit narcistic and infantile.<br />Igor Ru?8i&#263;, Radio 101</p>',1,'','<p><span class=\"suur\">MIRAN KURSPAHIC &amp; RONA ZULJ</span> /Croatia/</p>\r\n<p class=\"keskmine\"><span class=\"keskmine\">\"Geography victims 2: return of the victim\"</span></p>');

Why  ZUGA and why a piece for children? Well, actually it\'s why again really,  because ZUGA has made one already - 2004 saw the premiere of their  \"ZUGA&acute;s children performance\". It was fun to do for ZUGA and fun to look  at for the children. Plus, it got the children\'s theatre prize at the  Estonian Theatre showcase DRAAMA. So obviously, after a few years, ZUGA  still hasn\'t had enough. The performers themselves have children about 2  years old: hence the personal interest and remarks gathered by  observation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dance meets play. A journey with movement, sounds and music. Stops at  different parts of the body. Legs walk, run, jump, fall. Hands pat,  fly, grab. Heads nod, turn. Eyes blink and dance. No chairs. Everybody  will sit on the floor. If it feels like watching, just watch. If it  feels like taking part, just do it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>United dancers of ZUGA</strong> is a dance collective that was created  10 years ago by then young and active dance-makers Tiina M&ouml;lder, Kaja  Kann and Jarmo Karing.

By the fact that the actual location of a sleeping body becomes unimportant for its owner. A sleeping body/person has an existence that is out of control and out of context (disconnected from the actual surroundings). Thus the sleep can be imagined as a location that eliminates every other location and becomes the essential location. While sleeping we are consumed by our necessity to recycle, rebuild and re-organize ourselves in order to continue functioning while awaken to the over-connected everyday reality. Sleep is our ultimate home. Home that we can\'t leave, rent or sell.</p>\r\n<p><br />This body on stage displaces itself throughout a series of recycled (everyday and performative) materials. Following these actions, it tries to rebuild and re-organize itself in order to continue performing.</p>\r\n<p><br />Its nowhere-arrivals are accompanied by the mechanical and mental sounds of changing places: by a subway-musicians\' hit parade and by an elderly voice anchored in its monologue of memories.</p>\r\n<p><br />Equilibrium of a flying airplane: speed vs gravity.</p>\r\n<p><br />Nele Suisalu, June 2010</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nele Suisalu</strong> /EST/.

Sometimes there have been attempts to break away. To grow up. To be independent. To do things in a different way. We&acute;re grown out of teens and found our way back home, where it all started.\"<br />ZUGA is a dance company that exists only when ZUGA really wants. The effort of only one person is not enough for that. In 1999 we really wanted. The sea was deep and the Republic of Estonia was new and open. We gave performances in New York, San Diego, Yekaterinburg, Germany, Romania, Holland etc. Kind American uncle Soros supported us. We were important.<br />During 2006-2010 the members of ZUGA were active on their own. Everyone worked on what they found was most important. There was less and less travelling. As well as less grants. The world became tighter.<br />In 2010 all members simultaneously felt an urge to get together. To experience once again the pros and cons of group work. To get the picture of what has happened meanwhile both in personal view of world and in wider cultural scene. <br />In ZUGA no one is more important than the other. The rule that the one who screams louder is right is also not valid any more now when we are approaching 40. We have had to create new rules form the scratch, rules that make collaboration possible. Agreements that are not compromises. This is damn difficult. During the process it often felt like maybe never is better than late.<br />Now when the premiere is close we can say that it is possible ant it rocks.\"<br /><br /><strong>United dancers of ZUGA</strong> is a dance collective that was established 11 years ago by then young and active dance-makers Tiina M&ouml;lder, Kaja Kann and Jarmo Karing. Throughout the years the members have varied and many exciting works have been created. ZUGA loves process and brings it onto the stage refreshing the communication.

Why   ZUGA and why a piece for children? Well, actually it\'s why again really,   because ZUGA has made one already - 2004 saw the premiere of their   \"ZUGA&acute;s children performance\". It was fun to do for ZUGA and fun to look   at for the children. Plus, it got the children\'s theatre prize at the   Estonian Theatre showcase DRAAMA.

A journey with movement, sounds and music. Stops at   different parts of the body. Legs walk, run, jump, fall. Hands pat,   fly, grab. Heads nod, turn. Eyes blink and dance. No chairs.

We are fascinated by what is lost and found in translation. In dedication to discovery we will allow the translation of our aesthetics to be corrupted in the process. As artists nurtured in different cultures, nations, genders and movement styles, an essential aspect of this dance is the illumination of our own clich&eacute;s and assumptions in both physical and dramatic contexts. As movement artists we believe that the aesthetics of the intellect and the body are inseparable. Therefore our physicality will reflect a conscious questioning of the vocabularies we have encountered; classical ballet, release technique, partnering, camp and the pedestrian body. Vocabularies evoking heterosexuality, romantic love, trust and power dynamics enjoy particular attention. The unavoidable narrative of the &lsquo;love duet\' will neither be denied nor relied upon.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (313,'','<p>This performance consists of three short parts, Hot Pepper, Air Conditioner and the Farewell Speech. Set in an office, the plot revolves around a female temp staff who is soon to be dismissed as a result of the current recession. In a nutshell, it is a contemporary drama about temporary workers. In \"Hot Pepper,\" temporary employees consult a widely-circulated coupon magazine called \"Hot Pepper\" to find a suitable restaurant for a farewell party of their colleague Erika, who has been informed that her contract will be soon terminated. \"Air Conditioner\" enacts a conversation between two regular workers-a male and a female who do not share the temp staff\'s anxiety Erika\'s firing has caused. During the entire scene, the woman complains about the air-conditioning in their office being set too low, while the man expresses his sympathy for his co-worker. \"Farewell Speech\" dramatizes Erika\'s last words spoken 5 minutes before the end of work on the very last day of her contract. The speech is given in front of all the staff gathered around her.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By approaching the disciplines of dance and theater from various angles, chelfitsch,has always created its performances and developed methodologies through trial and error. This piece is not an exception. To take one of its sections as an example, in \"Air Conditioner\"-staged originally in 2004, Okada has sought to represent a tension or a gap between two different kinds of physicality: gestures as acting on one hand; physical movements that transpire in response to the background music on the other. Okada repeats a similar kind of experiment in the newly added two sections, but in different ways from the one he explored in \"Air Conditioner.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>chelfitsch Theater Company was founded in 1997 by Toshiki Okada, who writes and directs all of the company\'s productions. The name chelfitsch comes from a baby mispronunciation of the English word \"selfish.\" It first defined its radical aesthetic philosophy by using an extremely colloquial Japanese in Surprised by Their Hopes premiered in March of 2001. With Five Days in March [Sangatsu no Itsukakan] (2004), which won the prestigious Kunio Kishida Award for Best Script, and Apartment [Mansion] (2002), chelfitsch began to refine its aesthetics by juxtaposing words with a peculiarly noisy choreography derived from everyday gestures. The company\'s international debut was in 2007, when Five Days in March was invited to KUNSTENFESTIVALDESART in Brussels.

The aim of it is to make the spectators wander, enjoy, hate and contemplate at the performances presented in the theatres and on the streets of Tallinn.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">August DanceFestival 2011 ticket sales opens on June 15 offering:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>-single tickets on sale with price 5/8 EUR available until 07.08 and starting from 08.08 with full price 8/11 EUR at Piletimaailm&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.piletimaailm.com\">www.piletimaailm.com</a>&nbsp; and Piletilevi&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.piletilevi.ee\" target=\"_blank\">www.piletilevi.ee</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-limited number of FESTIVAL PASSPORTS, with price 25/50 EUR, providing access to all performances of the festival are on sale at Piletilevi until August 8</p>\r\n<p>-limited number of FESTIVAL SMALL PASSPORTS, with price 15/24 EUR, providing access to 4 chosen performances of the festival (have to be chosen at the box-offices) are on sale at the box-offices of Piletilevi available until August 8</p>\r\n<p>*Concession is valid for students and retired people upon presenting relevant document at the door.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">August DanceFestival 2011 program:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>15.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL</p>\r\n<p><strong>GUNILLA HEILBORN</strong>&nbsp;/Stockholm/:&nbsp;<strong>This Is Not A Love Story</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>16.08 / 20:00 Amphitheatre of the Estonian National Library</p>\r\n<p><strong>MIHKEL ERNITS &amp; LAURA KVELSTEIN</strong>&nbsp;/Tallinn/:&nbsp;<strong>It was good while it lasted</strong>&nbsp;(feat.

The turning begins gently, but it gradually transforms into insane gyratory motion. Within the singularity of his obsessive circular motion, Daniel Linehan introduces a series of variations, accelerations, and subtle shifts, creating a funny and complex dance. He subjects himself to strenuous physical and mental processes involving multiple simultaneous tasks: to speak, think, react, address the audience, etc., without ceasing his perpetual spinning. Linehan tells us that he is not speaking about desperation, endurance, or government policy; he is not speaking about celebrities, virtuosity, or metaphysical problems. Yet even though his words seem to negate, he calls to our attention these issues that evoke a world far larger than his contained little circle. Endlessly spinning around in the center of a shifting network of ideas, Daniel Linehan creates an inverted black hole, a space of disorienting vertigo perhaps, but also a space of thoughtful reflection where all of these ideas can flow and resound.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Created and performed by: Daniel Linehan</p>\r\n<p>Original lighting design by: Joe Levasseur</p>\r\n<p>Dramaturgy by: Juliette Mapp</p>\r\n<p>Funding: Not About Everything was created in part through the Bessie Sch&ouml;nberg/ First Light Commissioning Program and Creative Residency Program of Dance Theater Workshop with support from the Jerome Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts (a US federal agency), the New York State Council of the Arts, and the Jerome Robbins Foundation.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_en` VALUES (364,'','<p>\"ZUGA is a dance company that exists only when ZUGA really wants. The effort of only one person is not enough for that. In 1999 we really wanted. The sea was deep and the Republic of Estonia was new and open. We gave performances in New York, San Diego, Yekaterinburg, Germany, Romania, Holland etc. Kind American uncle Soros supported us. We were important. During 2006-2010 the members of ZUGA were active on their own. Everyone worked on what they found was most important. There was less and less travelling. As well as less grants. The world became tighter.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010 all members simultaneously felt an urge to get together. To experience once again the pros and cons of group work. To get the picture of what has happened meanwhile both in personal view of world and in wider cultural scene.</p>\r\n<p>In ZUGA no one is more important than the other. The rule that the one who screams louder is right is also not valid any more now when we are approaching 40. We have had to create new rules form the scratch, rules that make collaboration possible. Agreements that are not compromises. This is damn difficult. During the process it often felt like maybe never is better than late.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>United dancers of ZUGA is an umbrella dance collective that was established 11 years ago by then young and active dance-makers Tiina M&ouml;lder, Kaja Kann and Jarmo Karing. Throughout the years the members have varied and many exciting works have been created. ZUGA loves process and brings it onto the stage refreshing the communication.

Awakening of suspended energy. The eruption of puryfying power.<br /> <br /> The process begins almost unnoticed. Everything is dead calm. Ice plate slowly begins to crush. Melting ice takes everything redundant. Water rises step by step gently turning into mild garrulous stacatto gradually bursting into uncontroled chaos, vortex, in the end becoming a violent stream, a waterfall. It scares because it possess the presences of destruction. Finally it appears that it is necessary for the rebirth. Vital and desired.<br /> <br /> <em>\"FLOE\"</em>&nbsp;is not a choreographic solo however there is only one dancer performing. It is a creation based on movement within space, light and sound. It is a living image spread in time.<br /> <br /> The method of working is stretched between exploring the essence of every single element and finding their connections. Dance, sound and light are equally important to us. They flow in a parallel and independant way mingling together at the same time. This is why we decided to choose a Swiss artist, Nicole Seiler for the artistic manager of the project. She has been exploring these areas and scenic connections between them. Final artistic decisions are to close all the elements into a well balanced, ascetic and abstract unity. The story of a breaking ice layer.<br /> <br /> Monumental musical constructions of Jon Leifs, an Icelandic composer, observations of nature and sensuous experiences were our inspiration while creating the world of the spectacle. However they might not be directly found in it.</p>\r\n<p><cite>A woman in a black evening gown enters the stage, sets up a microphone and takes up her position at the control desk. A man, dressed as if he\'s going to a rock gig, begins to talk about his life as a choreographer and shows the results of years of making movement. He talks the audience through the dance, which is based around a very simple structure of contrasts. All aspects of the work - dance, music, lighting and performer - play with our perceptions to provoke amusement and curiosity. Is he serious, is he for real?

KONCENTRAT is a brand/trademark&nbsp;that imprints joint and individual projects of the group members. Common goal/denominator for our actions is - shared by all - way of perceiving art. KONCENTRAT does not stand for any particular style/trend in art.&nbsp;We seek our own way, own narratives, own language and intonation to tell the stories. The spectator is the main aspect in KONCENTRAT\'s thinking:&nbsp;we tend to seduce, provoke, bore, irritate, disappoint, but also enchant. We all derive from contemporary theatre that merges dramatic theatre, moving theatre, contemporary dance, performance - those aspects steer to/ focus on immediate confrontation with the audience.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Choreography and dance:<strong> </strong>Rafa&#322;

The performance is the second part of the trilogy that forms Oblivias three year project \"Entertainment Island\" on popular culture and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br /> \"There we were feeling like strangers out in the countryside baffled and bemused. The open landscape held a hint of claustrophobia, the silence became deafening. Only the gas station showed signs of life. After too many failed attempts at recreating local activities we were at a loss.<br /> <br /> We returned to the drawing board, where we realised that the combination of slow paced townhall gatherings and soap opera style dramas revealed a sinister side of popular culture and entertainment, where vulgarity and violence prevailed. <br /> <br /> The constant bombardment of moving images juxtaposed with passivity of mind uncovered a new approach. We embodied the fuzzy quality of bad television. A series of commercial breaks, wild west, super heroes, shoot outs, feel good, seedy bars and corrupt affairs rushes past, leaving all but a trail of pulp\".<br /> <br /> \"Entertainment Island\" is Oblivias project 2008- 2010. Through means of a performance trilogy, film, photography, seminar and text, Oblivia will scrutinize the manifold world of entertainment and popular culture. \"Entertainment Island\" in its entirety will be launched in 2010.

They have since been active in the vibrant theatre scene of Tokyo, contributing with a unique perspective and atmosphere represented in their performances.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Faifai views the world with sarcasm and sensitivity, and presents its stories with humor and sympathy. The way they create their performances involves much experimentation and improvisation, resulting in a natural play revealing the personalities of the actors. Essentially, most of their pieces are concerned with love and relationships, human characteristics that are common around the world. On the other hand, they also often portray Japan-specific social phenomena, showing the society in a very critical, but at the same time non-hostile way in their unique humorous style. Even though the stories are mostly taken from the everyday life, the way of presentation makes them rich in content. Also, by creating movement and inserting dance scenes as well as sophisticated visuals and sound Faifai makes their plays very saturated esthetically too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The group has been collaborating with artists from various fields of art, and created several space-specific performances. Even though Faifai is a very young company on the outset of its career, their activity has been followed by increasing awareness and popularity in Japan and abroad, and in the past years their work has been awarded by a number of awards by theatres and other organizations. In the future, the group plans to expand their activities through experimenting with different arts, as well as collaboration and performances abroad.&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Shortly on FAIFAI: Founded in 2004, this Tokyo based company consists of 10 core members, but frequently collaborates with a wider range of artists. Rather than merely producing theatre and dance performances, faifai aims to create enjoyable events that unite the audience in a common experience and atmosphere. The company often takes elements of our everyday lives, and rearranges them in a pop way,&nbsp; filling the stories with faifai\'s happy aura. Their euphoric work dealing with the complexity of today\'s society represents the resilience of the city and the people living in it. Faifai has recently attracted international attention and have been invited to perform at various events overseas.

Transit locations (airports, hotel rooms but also game centres, call shops, ...) are the base for our reflection on loneliness and the suspension in between here and elsewhere.

Faced with a non-linear narrative and a complex (scenic or urban) display, the spectator has to recompose, analyse and resolve. Our aim is to upset the traditional representative system - to overthrow the codes.

On top of zigzaging across the osmotic line separating the character and the performer as well as humorously playing with the duality of addresser and addressee it tries to describe the microcosm of an individual. Performances in general are often seen as games with certain codes which seemingly stand apart from our everyday life. We often think of the time spent in the theatre as being in another fictional world. How much do we believe in what we see on stage? Who is talking to us?

Knitting is not an art for me...\" <br /> <br />\"Talk to Me\" revolves around the problematics related to the performativity. On top of zigzaging across the osmotic line separating the character and the performer as well as humorously playing with the duality of addresser and addressee it tries to describe the microcosm of an individual. Performances in general are often seen as games with certain codes which seemingly stand apart from our everyday life. We often think of the time spent in the theatre as being in another fictional world. How much do we believe in what we see on stage? Who is talking to us? A character of a play or a person who happens to be on stage?<br /> <br />Possibly one of the most internationally acclaimed contemporary Estonian choreographers Mart Kangro focuses in his work on the meanings that the body and movements create and the concept of meaning in theatre as a semiotic time-space. Kangro has been engaged as a dancer at the Estonian National Opera. As a choreographer he has for a long time collaborated with Christina Ciupke and Thomas Lehmen.

Just imagine think groundbreaking work in molecular biology &amp; bioinformatics, \"space art\", prosthetics, genetic databases and last by not least creation of unforeseen biological (art) forms. Of course there\'s plenty more such as the project creating artificial aurora through firing a 100,000 watt beam to the magnetosphere from NASA space shuttle, or sending a message to space to our closest stars.<br />Davis, similarly renown in traditional arts has also achieved critical acclaim with his sculptures and installations mixing laser and welding technology, plastics, steel, and stone, such as the landmark sculpture \"Earth Sphere\", and has exhibited in the world\'s most recognized art events like \"Ars Electronica\".<br />In addition to his published works in Scientific American, Nature Magazine amongst numerous books, Davis is a frequent and demanded speaker on topics from visual culture to genetics, science and art.<br />And last but not least - a documentary on \"Heaven + Earth + Joe Davis\" is being completed, telling a few more words on the extraordinariness of the multitalented artist.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Thinking Machine is brought to you in cooperation with the US Embassy in Tallinn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><a href=\"http://www.plektrumfestival.com\"><span>www.plektrumfestival.com</span></a></span></p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',1,'','<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves> <w:TrackFormatting /> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing> <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing> <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery> <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables /> <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx /> </w:Compatibility> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=\"false\" LatentStyleCount=\"276\"> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <mce:style><!   /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:\"\"; 	mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0cm; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} --> <!--[endif] --> <!--StartFragment--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>PLEKTRUM FESTIVAL 2011:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Loenguseeria M&otilde;ttemasin esitleb: Joe Davis (USA)</span></p>');

They had not returned his calls. Forty-five minutes later, after trashing the receptionist!s desk and holding off the Cambridge police, Joe Davis walked out of Director Otto Piene\'s office with an academic appointment at MIT.<br />Over the years his status there has provided him with resources and collaborators for the creation and planning of much of his work - work that includes sending vaginal contractions into space to communicate with aliens; fishing for paramecia; encoding Greek poetry into the DNA of white-eyed flies; building an airplane powered by frog\'s legs; and developing a language to write the world beneath the world.<br />But perhaps his greatest obstacle is that people refuse to understand him. He is claimed by neither the Art nor Scientific communities. His uncompromising approach to art and life spawns conflicts in his personal life and hinders his ability to address the everyday world\'s banal requirements. But then, when you\'re trying to discover man\'s place in the cosmos, it\'s no surprise that other considerations seem small in comparison. Including recognition.<br />Working with home movies, drawings from Joe\'s notebooks, and v&eacute;rit&eacute; and interview footage, Heaven + Earth + Joe Davis takes the viewer with Joe around the world and into the visual and philosophical landscape of his art. It is a story of self-discovery, sacrifice, and the complexity of human endeavor, constructed around a theme central to his work; that everything is connected, often in the most unexpected ways.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Thinking Machine is brought to you in cooperation with the US Embassy in Tallinn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><a href=\"http://www.plektrumfestival.com\"><span>www.plektrumfestival.com</span></a></span></p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',1,'','<p>PLEKTRUM FESTIVAL 2011:</p>\r\n<div><span>kino.

From 2010 it has been possible to plan strategically and with funding, a curated pedagogy. This year and the following, an increased emphasis is placed on learning and networking with neighbouring and regional partners in Finland, Estonia and Russia. It could be equated as follows: PIXELVERSITY = PIXELACHE + DIVERSITY / UNIVERSITY.<br />Pedagogy is based on learning from experience and from peers: Learning by doing, and doing it together. Pixelversity aims to be a &lsquo;learning bridge\' between practitioners, cultural and non-profit organisations, interested individuals and larger institutions, and an outreach programme extending beyond Helsinki. As a &lsquo;curated pedagogy\' consideration is given to the relationships between the different activities, and how they may build up accumulative knowledge and skills towards future Pixelache Helsinki events, as well as strengthen the ability to engage in common issues with those nearby.<br />Participants:<br />* Andrew Gryf Paterson (Pixelache Helsinki) pixelversity<br />* Lilia Voronkova (Centre for Independent Social Research, St. Petersburg) voronkova<br />PIXELVERSITY = PIXELACHE + DIVERSITY / UNIVERSITY</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><a href=\"http://www.plektrumfestival.com\"><span>www.plektrumfestival.com</span></a></span></p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',1,'','<p>PLEKTRUM FESTIVAL 2011:</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><span>Pixelache festival esitleb: PIXELVERSITY</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Andrew Gryf Paterson (Helsingi), Lilia Voronkova (St. Peterburg)</p>\r\n</div>');

Perhaps this attitude is a component of the nihilism of our times which Nietzsche earlier diagnosed. Now that we are faced with hugely complex problems in economics, ecology, government, education, religion, biology, media, technology, etc., I believe that it is time to return to examination of the ideas of the great mid-twentieth century existentialists. Two writers who thought very deeply about the meaning of life were Albert Camus (French-Algerian) and Paul Goodman (American-Jewish New Yorker). What kind of social and individual life, according to Camus and Goodman, would be worth living for? What did Camus mean by \"The First Man\" (the title of the book that he was writing at the time of his death by car crash on January 4, 1960)? How could their ethics help us today to face the challenges of violence, simulation of democracy, alienation in work and social institutions, and increasing science-fictionalization of everyday life experience? And given that Camus and Goodman were both very much concerned with the figures of \"the artist\" and \"the rebel,\" how can artists, musicians, and social-political activists act to bring about a better life in the contemporary context?<br />Alan N.

Ongi ja Kangro v&otilde;taks seda komplimendina. Kuid tema kontseptuaalsus pole lihtsalt diibi panemine, see on suunatud, eesm&auml;rgiga. Ta kasutab enda ja publiku eelteadmisi ja -kogemusi etenduste vallas, m&auml;lestusi n&auml;htud suurejoonelisest ja h&otilde;lmavatest show\'dest. Nende struktuuri v&auml;lja tuues ja publiku ootusi tagasi peegeldades juhtub ta tajuma enda etendamiskeelt sellisena, nagu see on, ilma et oodataks midagi muud.

Oma lavastuses p&uuml;&uuml;ab ta v&auml;lja tuua, kuidas m&otilde;jutab laval olevat kunstnikku teadmine, et tema poolt tehtav s&otilde;ltub otseselt publiku reaktsioonist? Teadmine, et ta on laval paratamatult publiku armust ja heakskiidust? Millised esitajapoolsed kompromissid on vajalikud, et publik esineja kunstiliste ideedega kaasa suudaks tulla ja neist rahulduse saaks? V&otilde;ib juhtuda, et laval on &uuml;htaegu kolm etendust korraga - &uuml;ks tantsija kujutluses, teine vaatajate kujutluses ja kolmas nende vahel. Paradoks.<br /><br />Publikul on &otilde;igustatud ootus emotsionaalsele laengule ja kunstnikul &otilde;igustatud ootus saada m&otilde;istetud, anda publikule edasi oma kunstiline ideaal. Konflikt?

Publikul on kindlasti v&otilde;imalik kuulda nende igihaljast pala &rsquo;Raha&rsquo; ning teisigi tuntud ja varemk&otilde;lanud viise.<br /><br />Dueti Kann/Valkeap&auml;&auml; repertuaari kuuluvad v&auml;ga erinevad palad. Eeskujuks on olnud nii vana rockimees Mark Lanegan, kui ka Ali Farka Toure. Kaks kitarri ning h&auml;&auml;l, mis j&auml;tab ruumi ka liikumisele. Kindlasti ei j&auml;ta nad kuulajat k&uuml;lmaks, Kann/Valkeap&auml;&auml; duetti on &uuml;htaegu nii kiidetud kui ka laidetud, vihatud kui ka armastatud. Kuigi lauludes puudub klassikaline &uuml;lesehitus ja selgesti arusaadavad kordused, naudib b&auml;nd enda tegevust ja pakub seda naudingut ka publikule.<br /><br /><strong>Kaja Kann</strong> (1973) on tuntud omap&auml;rase vokaali-ja kitarritehnika valdamise poolest. &Uuml;ks mis kindel: ta naudib liikumist ja suitsuseid klubisid. Kaja Kannu s&otilde;nul on ta lavadel rohkem m&auml;ssanud kui talle meeldiks meenutada. Ikka ja j&auml;lle teeb ta seda uuesti. Kaja s&otilde;nul on nauditav ekselda &uuml;ksi ja siis avastada, et on koos Juhaga, eriti kihvt, kui samal ajal ka koos publikuga.

V&auml;ljaspool duetti on ta osalenud mitmetes rahvamuusika, punk-rocki, alternatiivsete heliruumide ja improvisatsiooniprojektides. Ta tahab riskida.

Ta &otilde;ppis Catherine Atlani ja hiljem Carolyn Carlsoni juures ning liitus tantsutrupiga GRCOP, mis resideerus Pariisi Ooperis. 1978. aastal sai tema esimene lavastus \"Mille j&auml;rgi sa janunesid?\" Bagnolet tantsukonkursil huumoripreemia. 1979. aastal tegi ta Avignoni festivali jaoks soolo \"Inimene-hobune\", mis koosnes matemaatilise t&auml;psusega komponeeritud pisiliigutustest. 1979. aasta detsembris sai ta stipendiumi &otilde;pinguteks New Yorgis, kus ta osales Merce Cunninghami, Douglas Dunni, Lucinda Childsi ja Meg Harperi juhitud kursustel. Seej&auml;rel kutsuti ta tagasi Prantsusmaale, liituma trupiga CNDC, mis resideerus Angersis ning mida sellal juhtis Alwin Nikolais. 1981 l&otilde;i ta sealse trupi liikmetega uue trupi Beau Geste, kuhu kuulusid Christine Graz, Isabelle Job, Marc Lawton, Agn&egrave;s David, Christine Erb&eacute; et Philippe Priasso. Viimased kaks olid trupi p&uuml;siliikmed. 1980ndatel tegi ta lavastusi oma trupiga Beau Geste (\"V&eacute;nus et les Toutous\" 1982, \"d&eacute;sir d&eacute;sir\" 1983, \"Strada Fox\" 1984, \"Princes de Paris\" 1985...) ja teiste truppidega: Grand Magazin (\"Strip-tease\" 1985), Louis Ziegler (\"Climat d\'amour\" 1988) ja Lolita (\"Zoopsie Comedi\" 1986). Koos G&eacute;rard Pessoni ja Caroline Gautierga tegid nad Rodolphe T&ouml;pfferi koomiksist lavastuse \"Les Amours de Monsieur Vieux Bois\" (1991). Samal aastal tegi ta oma koera Rita jaoks armastusduo \"Belles de nuit\". 1992 Lyon biennaali jaoks tegi ta lavastuse Bizet \"Carmen\'i\" p&otilde;hjal. 1997 tegi ta koreograafia Laurent Pelly lavastuse jaoks \"Orph&eacute;e aux Enfers\", mida n&auml;idati Genfis ja Lyon\'is, ning hiljem ka Lyoni Riikliku Ooperi jaoks \"P&auml;hklipureja\" koreograafia (2001).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cie.Beau Geste</strong> trupp loodi 1981 seitsme tantsija poolt, kes olid &otilde;ppinud ameerika koreograafi Alwin Nikolaisi poolt juhitud Prantsusmaa Riiklikus Kaasaegse Tantsu Keskuses. Olles kunstiline kollektiiv, kus m&auml;&auml;ravaks on erinevate esteetiliste vaatepunktide vahetus - iga tantsija on vaheldumisi nii koreograaf kui esitaja - on trupis Beau Geste &uuml;his- ja &uuml;ksikt&ouml;&ouml;de kaudu arenenud v&auml;lja &uuml;hine m&otilde;ttelaad, mida toidavad selle liikmete eri laadi kunstilised suundumused. 1991. aastal sai trupi kunstiliseks juhiks Dominique Boivin. Christine Erbel ja Philippe Priassol on muud &uuml;lesanded, kuid t&ouml;&ouml;tatakse alati kolmekesi. Nende t&ouml;&ouml;de olulisteks eesm&auml;rkideks on eesk&auml;tt s&auml;ilitada tantsija isikup&auml;ra ja liikumine, mis on omane just talle.

T&ouml;&ouml; tulemusena valmis lavastus \"12/8\". Nagu juba lavastuse \"Common Senses\" puhul, oli ka selle projekti aluseks muuska partituur, mis oli gruppi &uuml;hendamise vahendiks. Muusikaks (mida publik k&uuml;ll ei kuule) on Alejandro Sanz\'i teos \"12 por 8\". &Uuml;li&otilde;pilased &otilde;ppisid selle v&auml;ga keerulise pop-loo (mida iseloomustab 12/8 binaarseid ja terniaalseid r&uuml;tme kombineeriv ajasignatuur) selgeks a cappella seades. Laval l&auml;htuvavad nad m&otilde;tteliselt oma h&auml;&auml;ltest ja suhtlevad omavahel l&auml;bi liikumise, et j&auml;&auml;da s&uuml;nkrooni. Ka lavastuse \"Accords\" jaoks j&auml;tkas Hauert pol&uuml;r&uuml;tmilisel muusikal p&otilde;hinevate koreograafiliste p&otilde;him&otilde;tete otsinguid.

Esmakordselt kasutasid ZOO ja Hauert neid &uuml;hes stseenis lavastuses \"puzzled\" (2007). Selle meetodiga tekib tantsijate \"vahel\" kuulamisel p&otilde;hinev liikumine, mis on vastandiks liikumisele, mille sooritamise otsustab &uuml;ksainus tantsija. Ehkki liikumist sooritatakse unisoonis (mis v&otilde;ib ehk vaatja panna arvama, et liikumine on eelnevalt &uuml;les kirjutatud), piiravad teda k&uuml;ll teatud reeglid, kuid ta on valdavas osas improviseeritud. \"Liidri\" roll liigub alatasa &uuml;helt tantsijalt teisele. &Uuml;he tantsija liigutused, initsiatiivi ja impulsid v&otilde;tab koheselt &uuml;le teine tantsija, kes v&otilde;ib neid seej&auml;rel muuta. See sunnib tantijat pidevalt kuulatama ja olema t&auml;ielikult keskendunud ning valmis &uuml;ksk&otilde;ik millisel hetkel vastutust &uuml;le v&otilde;tma. Liikumine ei ole kellegi kontrolli all, kuid samas osalevad k&otilde;ik selle loomises.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Kui t&ouml;&ouml; pol&uuml;r&uuml;tmilise liikumisega seab grupis v&otilde;i kehas k&otilde;rvuti mitmeid meloodiaid &uuml;hest ja samast seadest, siis improviseeritud unisoonid avalduvad katkematus liikumisvoos. Ent kuna initsiatiiv tantsijate vahel alatasa edasi kandub - nad kuulevad &auml;kitselt midagi ja saavad sellest liikumiseks impulsi - v&otilde;ib see voog ajapikku hakata peegeldama muusikas leiduvaid erinevaid motiive.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Tantsijad v&otilde;ivad ka ajutiselt grupist eralduda. Sel juhul jaotub peavoog mtimeks eraldiseisvaks vooks , mis on selle kaudu, et nad ju &uuml;ht ja sedasama muusikat liikumisse t&otilde;lgivad, omavahel siiski seotud. Publik n&auml;eb, kuidas muusika l&auml;bi grupi kehan r&auml;ndab ja kuidas tantsijate pilkude liikumine seostub s&uuml;ndmustega, mis kuulduvad muusikas. V&otilde;ib tuua paralleeli ja k&otilde;rvutada seda tuulega, mille liikumist v&otilde;ib j&auml;lgida tuhande maisit&otilde;lviku &otilde;&otilde;tsumises v&otilde;i isegi liikuvat teksti n&auml;itavate LED-siltidega, mis &otilde;igupoolest koosnevad ju pelgalt vilkuvatest t&auml;ppidest.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Tants ja muusika on osa klassikaliselt kombinatsioonist, v&otilde;ib-olla isegi k&otilde;ige esmasemast. Inimene, kes seda lavastust vaatab, v&otilde;ib arvata, et n&auml;eb muusika j&auml;rgi seatud koreograafiat, sest ZOO tantsijad p&uuml;&uuml;avad j&otilde;uda muusika tajumises v&otilde;imalikult suure t&auml;psuseni. Kuid ometi on selle lavastuse puhul liikumise tekkimise protsess kardinaalselt teistsugune. See protsess on \"demokraatlik\" - p&otilde;hineb isiklikul vabadusele ja pideval t&auml;helepanul teiste tegemiste suhtes. Protsessi eesm&auml;rgiks on saavutada suurem koreograafiline keerukus, kui seda v&otilde;ib leida kindlaksm&auml;&auml;ratud koreograafiaga lavastustest.

(International Dreems Associated). <br />Peale oma tegevuse I.D.A. kunstilise juhina huvitab teda improvisatsioon, mis on viinud teda koost&ouml;&ouml;le paljude tantsijate, muusikute, valguskujundajate ja kujutavate kunstnikega. 1983. aasta v&otilde;itis tema inimkeha liikumist kujutavast fotoseeriast l&auml;htuv lavastus \"Trahisons - Men, Women, Humen\" Bagnolet tantsukonkursi Prantsusmaal. J&auml;rgmisel aastal j&auml;rgnes lavastus \"Nouvelles\", mis p&otilde;hines Gertrude Steini romaanil \"IDA\", mille ta lavastas Avignoni teatrifestivali jaoks. Aastatel 1990-1992 s&uuml;ndis kohaspetsiifiliste lavastuste seeria \"La Plaque Tournante\", mis &uuml;hendas omavahel tantsu, muusikat, videot ja valgust ning kunstnikke 10st eri Euroopa linnast. 1993. aastal tuli ta tagasi tavap&auml;rase teatriruumi kasutamise juurde ja lavastas vodevillkom&ouml;&ouml;dia \"Home\" kahele tantsijale-n&auml;itlejale. 1994. aastal s&uuml;ndis \"Channels\" suuremahuline linnafantaasia seitsmele tantsijale ja kolmele muusikule. Sellele j&auml;rgnes lavastus \"Gravity\" (1996) - \"reality show\" viiele tantsijale-n&auml;itlejale ja videole.<br />Ta on lavastanud ja esitanud mitmeid soolosid: \"La Valse de Vaslav\" (1999) - kummardus Ni?inskile, \"Witness\" (1992) - p&uuml;hendatud tantsijale ja koreograafile Harry Sheppardile, \"Under My Skin\" (1996) - kummardus Josephine Bakerile ja \"Icons\" (1998) - p&uuml;hendatud Valeska Gertile. Alates 1998. aastast esitab ta neid k&otilde;iki &uuml;hel &otilde;htul lavastuses &uuml;ldpealkirjaga \"Hommages\". <br />1998-2000 olles residentuuris Strassbouris, s&uuml;ndis lavastused: \"La vie r&ecirc;v&eacute;e d\'Aim&eacute;\" (1999) - muusikaline kom&ouml;&ouml;dia igas vanuses noortele, \"RemiXamor\" (2000) - kirekeha panoraam. Detsembris 2002 valmis \"Fandango\" - lavastus 10-le Junior Ballet (CNSMD de Paris) tantsijale. 2001-2004 oli ta seotud Pariisi Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Cit&eacute; rahvusvahelise programmiga. Sel ajal valmis lavastus \"En Chantier\" - kolme-aastane uurimisprojekt, mis leidis aset renoveeritavas endises teatrimajas.<br />Pikaajaline koost&ouml;&ouml; t&otilde;ttu helilooja Nuno Rebeloga osaleb ta ka rock-b&auml;ndis. 2005. aastal andis \"Mark Lewis and the Standards\" v&auml;lja oma esimese albumi. 2007. aastal lavastas ta oma lugude p&otilde;hjal soolo-karaoke-kontserdi \"kings&amp;queens\".<br />2005. aastal esietendub soolo \"Sept Voiles\", milleks Tompkins sai inspiratsiooni Salom&eacute; ja Ristija Johannese loost. Samal aastal valmib grupit&ouml;&ouml; \"ANIMAL Male\", mis k&auml;sitleb v&otilde;itluse, elluj&auml;&auml;mise, v&otilde;imu ja domineerimise teemasid. 2007. aastal j&auml;rgnes sellele lavastus \"ANIMAL Female\"<br />2008. aastal taaselustas Tompkins I.D.A. 25-aastase juubeli puhul 1983. aasta soololavastuse \"empty holes - the life and love and death of John and Doris Dreem\". 2008. aastal valmis ka lavastus \"LULU an operetta of circumstance\", mille eest ta p&auml;lvis SACD koreograafiapreemia.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>idee, tekstid, laulud*, esitus, t&otilde;lgendus: <strong>Mark Tompkins </strong>(v&auml;lja arvatud: \"non je ne regrette rien\" Vaucaire/Dumont, \"strangers in the night\" Kaempfert/Singleton/Snyder, \"am i blue\" Clark/Akst, \"last dance\" Jabara<br />dramaturgia ja lavastus: <strong>Gerard Gourdot</strong><br />valgus: <strong>Alain de Cheveign&eacute;</strong><br />tehnilised lahendused: <strong>Rodolphe Martin</strong><br />Esietendunud aprillis 1983 festivalil Festival Bonjour Prantsusmaal Perpignanis.<br />Taastatud oktoobris 2008 festivalil Festival ActOral / M.O.D., Marseille ja Pariisi Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Cit&eacute; rahvusvahelise programmi jaoks.<br />Tallinna etendusi toetab: <strong>Prantsuse Kultuurikeskus, CULTURESFRANCE</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.idamarktompkins.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">http://www.idamarktompkins.com/</span></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[popimg] empty-holes-01.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-02.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-03.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-04.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg] [popimg] empty-holes-05.jpg %% Allkiri [/popimg]</p>',1,'','<p>Augusti TantsuFestival 2009:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"suur\">MARK TOMPKINS</span> /PRANTSUSMAA/ <span class=\"keskmine\">\"empty holes\"</span></p>');

As a series of comments on media EVERGREEN is opening up paradoxical layers of our perception and different understandings of media translations.<br /><br />Easily lost in the commodities of our society, the radicals of amusement ensure raw material for the present cynical need of utopia. Therefore, everything looks so homely ...<br />Between terrorism and tourism, there is rather a need of micropolitics than the exposure of essential elements and scenes. EVERGREEN does not fetch dramatic interventions but subtle operations and sensual dynamics.<br />EVERGREEN is a chain of actions: from Boris Mihalj to Gertrude Stein (1994) - from The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845) to robots - from the French chanson Ne me quitte pas to the Japanese notebook in white acrylic - from the current weather forecast to the symphony orchestra conductor\'s final explanation of EVERGREEN - from applauding to laughing of twenty-one green crocodiles.<br />Creative media assimilate and scatter the pigeonholing into intermedia and performing arts, into sports and chess, into politics and art, etc. The family circle has expanded. The character of an individual or his work is no longer formed by merely two serious and clumsy family experts. EVERGREEN establishes fluid relationships among the big and the small and enables subtle operations and sensual dynamics to manifest themselves in the imperative of contemporaneity - the empathy. Through this, the whole world is wise again (as it always was).<br /><br />The <strong>GVR babaLAN </strong>team acts in a way that most of its orientation, style and way of work is told by its artists:<br /><strong>Boris Mihalj</strong> (1965) is a Doctor of Historical Anthropology of Art (ISH Ljubljana), a Bachelor of Theatre Acting (Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television, Ljubljana) and a Bachelor of Painting from the Venice Academy of Fine Arts. He is an active member of the Ljubljana Slovene National Theatre. In 1994, he performed the legendary role of Gertrude Stein.<br />Vlado G. Repnik (1961) is an Academic Painter (Academy of Fine Arts and Design, Ljubljana), a Bachelor of Theatre and Radio Directing and a Master of Arts (Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television, Ljubljana). As an independent artist, he is working in the field of performance art, new media, performing and visual arts. As a polymedia artist, he is involved in different creative fields, such as manifestations, the invasion of the real, visual lectures and other paradoxical connections. He received several work awards and was involved in artist-in-residence programs. Periodically, he gives lectures at different art institutions. Outside Slovenia, his work has been presented at international festivals and in publications in Berlin, Prague, Paris, Madrid, Avignon, Maubeuge, Zagreb, Belgrade, London, Rome, Tallinn, New York, Lisbon, Barcelona, Vienna, Athens and Tokyo.<br /><strong>Martina Ruhsam </strong>(1981) graduated in Dance and Performance Studies in Linz in 2004. Currently she is finishing the Studies of Theatre, Film and Media at the University of Vienna. As a choreographer and performer, she presented several transmedial projects: \"One dollar one dollar\" (dietheater, Imagetanz Festival Vienna), \"H_STORY\" and \"Blank Protest\" (City Museum of Ljubljana), &ldquo;StrgC_StrgV&rdquo; (Choreographic Platform Linz) and \"Take One\" (Vienna). She is a member of the editorial board of Corpus Magazine &ndash; an internet magazine for dance, choreography, and performance art. <br /><strong>Miran Trontelj,</strong> a legendary weather forecaster.<br /><strong>Igor &Scaron;tromajer </strong>(1967) is a Bachelor of Theatre and Film Directing (Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television, Ljubljana), a freelance artist and an intimate mobile internet communicator.

As a guest artist, he is lecturing at universities and contemporary art institutes across Europe and Canada. His works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art Ljubljana, Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Museo Nacional Reina Sofia in Madrid and Computerfinearts Gallery in New York.<br /><strong>Toshihiro Yonezu</strong> became an Assistant to the Music Director of the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra in September 2006 and was engaged to conduct the Orchestra already in November. He was born in Japan in 1972. He started his professional music education at the Aichi University, where he studied Musical Theory and Piano. Later on, he finished his Studies of Conducting in Tokyo.

Sel aastal on fookusesse v&otilde;etud popi afektiivne ihamaailm ja selle &uuml;mbert&otilde;lgendused, hommage`id, samastumised ning kriitika interdistsiplinaarses performance`ikultuuris; kopuleerumised b&auml;ndistruktuuride ja staarimaailmaga, idios&uuml;nkraatilised identifikatsioonikogemused, personaalse ja iga&uuml;he enda p&auml;risoma \"Club Adorator\": iha, depressiooni, seksuaalsuse, saamise, meeleheite, eufooria, naiivsuse, nartsissismi, kehalisuse, fantaasia, cool`i, perversiooni, v&otilde;imu, vabaduse ja raha p&ouml;&ouml;rane maailm.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Freudile toetudes purustas Lacan &uuml;he v&auml;ikese s&otilde;rmenipsuga m&uuml;stifitseeriva romantilise k&auml;sitluse kunstnikust kui (kannatavast) geeniusest t&otilde;lkides selle &uuml;mber ps&uuml;hhopatoloogia keelde. Tema k&auml;sitluses ei ole kunstnik mingi jumaliku andega eneseh&auml;vitaja vaid lihtsalt kaevunud s&uuml;gavamale inimese tumedama poole uuringutesse - kunstnik ei tee midagi muud kui lihtsalt kohtub id-iga, semmib teadvustamatuga pisut s&uuml;gavamalt kui tavaline inimene. Ta pole seega \"jumalikum\" kui tavap&auml;rane erkade aistingutega degenerant kuigi iga degenerant ei ole veel kunstnik. N&auml;ib nagu valdaks kunstnik mingit saladust, mille tema kunst suudab esile manada. Kunstnik oleks justkui sellele teadvustamatule suurele Asjale, millest me k&otilde;ik paratamatult eraldatud oleme, l&auml;hemal, mis k&auml;ivitab meis omakorda ihamasina. Paneb meid teda, tema salap&auml;ra ihalema. Ta justkui teaks ja n&auml;itaks meile midagi, mida meie ei tea.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kuigi Freud k&auml;sitles kunstnikku kui pehmet neurootikut, ei pidanud Lacan sobivaks ps&uuml;hhoanal&uuml;&uuml;si pedantset kasutamist kunsti anal&uuml;&uuml;simiseks. &Uuml;helt poolt olevat kunstilisel sublimatsioonil sotsialiseeriv toime &not;- niisiis kultuur, mitte patoloogia - teisalt olevat kunstnik ainese osas anal&uuml;&uuml;tikust alati eespool. Ometigi on Lacani kunst tungi, sunduse ja paratamatuse kunst.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lacani k&auml;sitlus eeldab seda, et kunstnikul on afektiivne, vahetu suhe teadvustamatuga. Postmodernses kultuuriruumis on see suhe aga paratamatult juba objektiviseeritud ja kontseptualiseeritud - viidud m&auml;ngulisele metatasandile. Samas n&auml;ib Lacani teooria p&auml;devat kaasajal k&otilde;ige paremini just ihat&ouml;&ouml;stuse keskme ehk popkultuuri kohta: iha industrialiseerus popit&ouml;&ouml;stuses.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>K&auml;esoleva aasta festival &uuml;ritabki tungida s&uuml;gavale popi ja rokenrolli kogemuse sisse ning seda &uuml;mber k&auml;ideldes j&otilde;uda uute k&otilde;rgusteni. Me n&auml;eme siin b&auml;nde, kes teevad seda nagu kunsti ja me n&auml;eme siin kunsti, mida tehakse nagu b&auml;ndi. Kohal on f&auml;nnid, gruupid, anti- ja pseudostaarid, \"professorid\" ja teised. Meie meetod on minnalaskmine. Pidu kestab. Vaid meeleheide on kaldunud vasakult paremalt.

Nad v&otilde;tavad erineva keele, erinevad kultuuritaustad, igap&auml;evatavad ja p&uuml;&uuml;avad luua laval maailma, mis s&uuml;mboliseeriks nende erinevuste kokkusulamist. Koos t&ouml;&ouml;tavad kolm kunstnikku, kolm inimest, kes on k&otilde;ik erinevate taustadega. V&otilde;tavad &uuml;ksteiselt &uuml;le impulsse ja teadmisi. Nad kaasavad ka muid inimesi. K&uuml;sivad, uurivad, p&uuml;&uuml;avad tajuda. Ja k&uuml;sivad uuesti. Sest l&otilde;ppkokkuv&otilde;tteks s&uuml;nnib ju k&otilde;ik inimeste peades. Uuringute, lavastuse ja selle ettevalmistamisega p&uuml;&uuml;ame me k&uuml;simuse alla seada k&auml;itumismustreid antud kultuuride vahel. Kuiv&otilde;rd omavad meie &uuml;le kontrolli meie &uuml;hiskonna ja igap&auml;evaelu \"mitte-teadlikud eelarvamused\"? Keel ja igap&auml;evaharjumised on osa meie &uuml;hiskondlikust kuuluvusest. Me arvame, et me m&otilde;istame, kes meie kaaskodanikud on ja kuidas neil &otilde;igupoolest l&auml;heb... aga tegelikult ei saa me tihtilugu aru v&auml;ikseimatestki kultuurilistest erinevustest. Kuhu nad v&auml;lja j&otilde;uavad kui p&uuml;&uuml;avad rekonstrueerida praegu, 2009. aastal toimuvat erinevate kultuuritaustade, -normide ja -v&auml;&auml;rtuste vahelist lahingut? Kas uurimise k&auml;igus selguvad ainult eesti-venelaste ja eesti-eestlaste vahelised erinevused v&otilde;i ilmub v&auml;lja ka paralleele teiste riikide ja olukordadega mujal maailmas?<br /><br /><em>And so it was. Hapukurk on the table, a fairy on a branch of a tree. A passing by tram showed me smeh skvoz slezy in its window. And I smiled while I was being watched by Ivan Durak who touched his shoulder and disappeared. After crossing the right upper corner of Russkaya Dusha I bumped into Kalevipoeg who hit me directly into my soul. While Russkaja Baba v Izbe was still dreaming with her best friends. Belka I Strelka were born but were never asked to. Izbushka na kuryich nozhkah at that particular moment was wearing three stripes in red colour. Neverland seems too far away from fear under the Pakt Molotova-Rippentropa. While she was running on, not willing to see. Every now and then cheburek was passing, kama far away, vodka very close, but nothing there. \"Kolm L&otilde;vi\" he said out loud.<br /><br />KKK<br />- Oot, see on siis tantsulavastus v&otilde;i mis?<br />- Jah.</em><br /><br /><strong>Renzo van Steenbergen</strong> (1977) on s&otilde;ltumatu mitmek&uuml;lgne kunstnik, kes on tegev valdkondades nagu installatsiooni kunst, muusika ja kompositsioon, film, kaasaegne teater ja live-kino.

Ongi ja Kangro v&otilde;taks seda komplimendina. Kuid tema kontseptuaalsus pole lihtsalt diibi panemine, see on suunatud, eesm&auml;rgiga. Ta kasutab enda ja publiku eelteadmisi ja -kogemusi etenduste vallas, m&auml;lestusi n&auml;htud suurejoonelisest ja h&otilde;lmavatest show\'dest. Nende struktuuri v&auml;lja tuues ja publiku ootusi tagasi peegeldades juhtub ta tajuma enda etendamiskeelt sellisena, nagu see on, ilma et oodataks midagi muud. Selleks p&uuml;&uuml;ab ta leida ,m&auml;nge, mis juhivad t&auml;helepanu etenduse vastuv&otilde;tu paradoksidele ja sisemistele j&otilde;ujoontele. Kasutab &auml;raj&auml;tmisi ja taandamisi. Rakendab kogemuste kommentaari. Sunnib m&otilde;tlema ja nuputama, oma raadiot t&auml;pselt &otilde;igele jaamale kruttima, et vaataja n&auml;eks just seda etendust, mis parasjagu ta silme ees aset leiab. Paneb vaatama tajuma oma eelh&auml;&auml;lestust ja ootusi, m&otilde;nes m&otilde;ttes j&auml;&auml;ke eelmistest n&auml;htud etendustest ja show\'dest. Vaatem&auml;ngulisus on ta etendustes olemas, kuid kohas, mis pole ehk ootusp&auml;rane.</p>\r\n<p>Kangro uus soololavastus \"Can\'t Get No / Satisfaction\" on selle poindi selge n&auml;ide. Oma lavastuses p&uuml;&uuml;ab ta v&auml;lja tuua, kuidas m&otilde;jutab laval olevat kunstnikku teadmine, et tema poolt tehtav s&otilde;ltub otseselt publiku reaktsioonist? Teadmine, et ta on laval paratamatult publiku armust ja heakskiidust? Millised esitajapoolsed kompromissid on vajalikud, et publik esineja kunstiliste ideedega kaasa suudaks tulla ja neist rahulduse saaks? V&otilde;ib juhtuda, et laval on &uuml;htaegu kolm etendust korraga - &uuml;ks tantsija kujutluses, teine vaatajate kujutluses ja kolmas nende vahel. Paradoks.</p>\r\n<p>Publikul on &otilde;igustatud ootus emotsionaalsele laengule ja kunstnikul &otilde;igustatud ootus saada m&otilde;istetud, anda publikule edasi oma kunstiline ideaal. Konflikt? V&otilde;ib-olla.

Ja n&uuml;&uuml;d, paar aastat hiljem, pole ZUGAl ikka veel isu t&auml;is.

Rongis&otilde;it l&auml;bi liikumise, helide, muusika. J&auml;rjest saavad t&auml;helepanu erinevad kehaosad: jalad k&otilde;nnivad, jooksevad, h&uuml;ppavad, kukuvad; k&auml;ed silitavad, paitavad, lendlevad, haaravad kinni; pead noogutavad, p&ouml;&ouml;ravad; silmad pilguvad ja tantsivad.<br />Toole ei ole, istutakse maas.

Peokonteineri algidee on v&auml;ljendada s&otilde;ltumatust k&otilde;ikv&otilde;imalikest takistustest, millega kunstnik ja tema t&ouml;&ouml; pidevalt rinda pistma peab - alates kunstiruumi puudumisest, energiast ja vahenditest. Selleks on MIMproject ehitanud endale oma \'galerii\', oma \'elektrij&otilde;ujaama\' ja pea kogu vajaminev tehnika on &uuml;mberehitatud pr&uuml;gi. Konteiner on liikuv galerii ja j&otilde;ujaama mootoriteks aktiivsed ja uudishimulikud linnakodanikud - need, kes soovivad teada, mitu kilovattundi nende kontidesse peidetud on; keda huvitavad seosed energia, heli ja valguse vahel; v&otilde;i need, kes soovivad lihtsalt pidutseda isem&auml;ngiv automaatb&auml;nd taustaks. \"Self Sustainable Party Container\" esimese versiooni avamine toimus m&auml;rtsis 2010 Helsingis PixelAche festivali raames, koost&ouml;&ouml;s Soome kunstnike r&uuml;hmitusega Association of experimental electronics.</p>\r\n<p><br />MIMproject meeskond:</p>\r\n<p>Maike Lond - muusik, interdistsiplinaarne kunstnik, l&otilde;petanud ArtScience eriala Haagi Kuninglikus Akadeemias.

Kunstituru kontekstis on kunstnik pidevalt situatsioonis, kus ta produtseerib, organiseerib ja reklaamib oma tegevust ning tegeleb oma loomingu levitamisega. Samuti peab ta igal hetkel olema valmis selgitama, misp&auml;rast on ta kunstnikuna valinud just sellise kunstilise l&auml;henemise.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_et` VALUES (219,'','<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Isabelle Kirouac</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Isabelle Kirouac is a dancer and physical performer born in Quebec, Canada. Her work draws its inspiration from Contact Improvisation, butoh, performance art, low-tech video, experimental music and northern studies. Imprinted by her studies of improvisation and participatory work, she is interested in minimal dances that speak clearly and cultivate presence and connections. Over the last years, Isabelle has been performing and teaching internationally with The Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theatre, best known for its acrobatic stilt dramas, and Body Research, a company crossing the boundaries between theatre, dance, and self-exploration, using the disciplined study of Contact Improvisation as one of its main tools. She participated to numerous festivals, such as the Forum International de Las Culturas de Monterrey (Mexico), The Edinburgh Fringe Festival (Scotland), Danse Encore (Canada)(...), and collaborated with Diodramas (Quebec), Superamas (France/Austria), Flam Chen (Arizona), Rumblepeg (California), Felix Ruckert (Berlin), film/installation artists Daichi Saito and Karl Lemieux (Double Negative Collective, Montreal), and the percussionist Chris Cogburn (No Idea Festival, Texas).<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project description</span><br />The Cryonic Woman is a poetic performance installation exploring the quest of immortality of a Northern woman and pushing the boundaries between real and imagined. As to be remembered, to become immortal, projected images and personal information about us multiply online. Imprinting memories as a way to defeat our ephemeral nature, fame slowly replaces religion. Blurring the lines between real and imagined, which layers of us can still be us? \"If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.\" The Cryonic Woman represents the plenitude and the solitude of the North: \"Everywhere, a huge nowhere.\" In this landscape, we are looking further than ourselves, into ourselves and out of ourselves, to find what we are missing, what we can only find in extreme solitude. The Cryonic Woman has been created in Montreal (Canada) in 2009, with the collaboration of 2boys.tv, OBORO New Media Lab and Studio 303. This multimedia performance integrates live performance, sounds, objects and video-projections.<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rebecca Pappas</strong><br />Biography</span><br />From 1997 to 2001 Rebecca Pappas attended Connecticut College where she studied dance under Dan Wagoner and Jeremy Nelson. Upon graduation Pappas moved to Oakland, CA where she began choreographing under the name Pappas and Dancers. There she created 12 original works and was presented at venues including The Yerba Buena Gardens, ODC Theater, The Cowell Theater, and Theater Artaud. Her company also appeared in the Monterey Dance Festival, Westwave/Summerfest, The Underserved at ODC, The Yerba Buena Gardens Festival, and twice at the Women on the Way Festival. During this time she developed a style whose hallmark was delicate, self-contained movement worlds and idiosyncratic gesture. Since moving to Los Angeles in 2006, she has been well-received by critics and audiences alike, and Sara Wolf of the Los Angeles Times recently referred to her work as \"mesmerizing\" and \"compelling.\" Iterations of Monster have been presented in California, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New York at venues including The Contemporary Jewish Museum, Connecticut College, and Movement Research at Judson Church. Monster is reflective of P and D\'s interest in approaching the body as an archive for physical and social histories. In researching Monster Pappas traveled to Tel Aviv where she served as Barak Marshall\'s choreographic assistant during the Bridge Choreographic Dialogues Program. In addition she has been a rehearsal assistant for Melanie Rios Glazer at the Wooden Floor and has performed for artists including Victoria Marks, Alma Esperanza Cunningham, Rachael Lincoln, and Erica Shuch. Pappas\' work has received choreographic residencies at Yaddo, Dragon\'s Egg and Shotwell Studios, and funding from the Clorox Company Foundation, the Zellerbach Family Foundation, and the Mellon Committee for Research on the Holocaust in American and World Culture.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Rebecca Pappas will present \"Thumbnail,\" a solo excerpt from Monster. Monster, a quartet that excavates the corporeal legacy of the Holocaust and explores the way history is layered onto the contemporary Jewish body in Diaspora. The piece begins with an invocation of names and gestures meant to perform \"The Holocaust Effect,\" Ernst van Alphen\'s theory that certain tropes: lists of name, catalogs of faces, train tracks etc. will inevitably remind viewers of the Holocaust. From there it goes on to look at how memorial culture, historical memory, and cultural trauma are accumulated on and form the Jewish body or that of any \"victimized\" group. In the piece the dancer\'s bodies are constantly shape shifting- alternately becoming monsters, memorializers, victims and victimizers as they try on various physicalities. Monster is a danced intervention within an official \"Jewish history\" that draws a straight line of justification between the devastation of the Holocaust and the brutality of Israel and a clear delineation between the victims and the victimizers. Pappas will also present a performed paper that traces the development of the piece and its historical and artistic source material. This lecture contextualizes the work and examines other works by artists grappling with the contemporary legacy of the Holocaust, Jewish history, and the body including Adi Ness and Christian Boltanski.<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cid Pearlman</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Cid Pearlman is currently a Fulbright Scholar (academic year 2009- 2010), teaching at Tallinn University and collaborating with Estonian dance artists. Her work has been presented by numerous venues including Joyce SoHo (New York City), the Getty Center (Los Angeles), Theater Artaud (San Francisco) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (San Diego). From 1991-1999 she was the artistic director of San Francisco\'s critically acclaimed Nesting Dolls. In 1999 Pearlman relocated to Los Angeles, establishing herself as an independent choreographer and producer. Her most recent collaborations have been with composers Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of Kronos Quartet, and Jonathan Segel of Camper Van Beethoven. In addition to her own works, Pearlman has choreographed for film, opera and theater. Her evening length dance, \"High Fall,\" won the 2002 Lester Horton Award for Visual Design, and 2006\'s \"small variations,\" was nominated for two Horton Awards. Pearlman received both her BA in World Arts and Cultures, and her Master of Fine Arts degree in Dance from the University of California, Los Angeles. After completing her graduate studies, she moved to Santa Cruz, California in 2006, and teaches in the Dance Department at Cabrillo College. Her work has received support from the Djerassi Resident Artist Program, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the San Francisco Art Commission, the Zellerbach Family Fund, the Walter and Elise Haas Fund, the American Composers Forum and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. Pearlman will premiere the works she is creating with Estonian dancers at Kanuti Gildi Saal, 25-26 May and at NOTAFE 12-17 July.<br />Project Description<br />Cid Pearlman will present excerpts from \"This is what we do in winter\" and \"catch-as-catchcan.\" The first work is a quintet, which was created during Pearlman\'s Fulbright year in Estonia. The second work was developed in 2006 with dancers from Los Angeles, and will be performed by 3rd year BA students from the Choreography Department at Tallinn University. Pearlman will also present a paper on her approach to choreographing difference in 2006\'s \"small variations.\"<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Rain Saukas &amp; Alexis Steeves</strong><br />Biographies</span><br />Rain Saukas is a professional dancer and graphic designer based in Tallinn.

It<br />was founded in 1992 when five dancers from \"Nordstar\" dance theatre formed their own group. In early 90-ies their work was influenced by traditional modern dance techniques, since the end of 90-ies the working methods have changed, combining various approaches to human movement and dance as an art. Since 1997, the key figures of the theatre have been Rene N&otilde;mmik and Tiina Ollesk.<br />Fine 5 has worked with many respected choreographers including Tommi Kitti (Finland), Matteo Moles (Belgium) etc. Fine 5 is the laureate of several international dance contests and festivals. The company has performed in USA, France, Italy, Sweden, Cyprus, Finland, Poland, Baltic States, Russia and Belorussia. The company has successfully performed at the internationally well-known Birgitta Festival in Tallinn, Estonia. Their choreography for C.Orff \"Carmina Burana\" (in the program since 2005) will be presented again in Birgitta 2010. In 2003 Fine 5 received the Philip Morris Dance Award in Estonia; in 2009, the Estonian Theater Award in the Dance productions category for \"PHASES\" \"an enriching dialogue between live music and choreography, artistically convincing presentation of a topical subject and continuity in developing its own style and training new generations.\" A former actress, and Associate Professor at Estonian Music and Theater Academy, Maret Mursa graduated from the Alexander Technique Institute of Finland (MSTAT, 1999), working on the doctoral thesis \"The use of conscious inhibition in the work of a performing artist.\"<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Excerpt from \"4 vaadet\" (work in progress)<br />Once again, after 20 years of practice as dancers, choreographers and teachers we took time to research what we do and why we do it. How lived lives and gathered experience helps (or doesn\'t) to motivate doing it and sharing it. In the final version of the piece (premier October 2010) we will reflect on the issues of a \"live\" dance and identity exploring four different ideas - identities in the same frame of set choreography - to create new and different \"live\" journeys every time.<br />We see creating a new work as a journey with or without audience. This journey explores the grey area between clear images and bodily action, physicality and emotion in partnership and vulnerability. Today the &lsquo;live\" aspect has almost become an obsession, there are many illusions of simultaneous encounters with the outside world. Digitalization of everyday life and communication creates a longing for the \"real,\" the unique event that happens only once, and is live..<br /> <br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Elo Unt</strong><br />Biography</span><br />Elo Unt graduated from the choreography department of the University of Tallinn. She works in E.T.A. Dance School as dance teacher and choreographer since 2003. She has created short numbers and dance productions in quantities that have also reached the School Dance Festival\'s Final Concert every year, and merited special prizes as well as two Laureate titles. Elo\'s choreographical language is contemporary but recognizably Estonian, very dynamic and musical and her productions are always crowned with a humorous point. The current performance is Elo\'s first full-length dance performance.<br />Estonian Dance Agency Dance School is for children and young aged 4-25 years. Altogether<br />more than 400 pupils study at our school annually. The school\'s preparatory stage is the Kaie K&otilde;rb Ballet Studio where children aged 4-11 years study (main subjects being classical dance, acrobatics, rythmics, creative dance and contemporary dance). The ballet studio was established in 1999.<br />The main stage at school is E.T.A. Studio that was established in autumn 2004 with the goal of training young dancers aged 12-18 with a versatile dance technique during the six-year-long study period and who have the wish to continue studying dance at higher education institutions. Study is based on classical, contemporary and jazz dance techniques. In addition to offering professional dance education, Estonian Dance Agency Dance School has taken upon its mission to ensure dancers with outputs such as various dance projects and concerts that would bring more pupils to develop their physical and creative capabilities through the techniques of the art of dance. Youth group Twister was established in spring 2007 and the Youth Dance Theatre in spring 2009.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Dance performance &bdquo;ESTONIANS\' FOUR O-s\"- Otsides (Looking), Oodates (Waiting), Olles (Being) and Ohkides (Moaning)...\"<br />Idea and story: Elo Unt and Kristjan Kurm<br />Direction, choreography and costumes: Elo Unt<br />Performers: Mirjam Luhakooder, Siim Adamson, Liisa Laine, Greta Raidma, Anne&Ouml;&ouml;sike Niit, Ingmar J&otilde;ela<br />Music mix and sound effects: K&uuml;lli T&uuml;li<br />Production: Jane Miller-P&auml;rnam&auml;gi<br />Performance makes use of music by authors: Mari Kalkun, Paabel, Ursula<br />Premiere: August 7, 2009 in Kingston, Jamaica<br />Duration: 30 min<br />Otsides - looking for something, Oodates - waiting for somebody, wanting to be - Olla - somebody and thus Ohkides - moaning through life - from day to day, from evening to morning, from yesterday to today, from today to tomorrow, from tomorrow to the day after, etc.<br />This is a story about us, it is Estonian through and through. You wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and you see an Estonian. You go to bed in the evening, wake up the next day, look in the mirror again - nothing has changed. In the meantime, you take a sauna, scrub the dirt off and put on foreign clothes but the mirror still shows the same Estonian - you take a deep breath, moan and again tomorrow you will try to change something that is unchangeable. The performance tries to decipher the essence of an Estonian, portraying his genetical complexes and behaviors. Four O-s or O4 would be like the genetic formula of the essence of an Estonian. An Estonian is a workaholic, a party animal who has no sense of moderation in anything. Therefore, an Estonian is unable to love or feel joy and is constantly thriving towards obtaining things that are newer and brighter - it\'s never enough, it\'s never good enough. As if spending the whole life looking for something that does not exist, or wanting to be somebody who you are not able to be. That\'s why all of our mornings are &bdquo;blue Mondays\" regardless the century we are living in. Nevertheless, an Estonian is quite a sweet creature who, at the end of the day, still crawls into his cave and settles down. Even if the cave is small, it is his own and that\'s what is important. The performance has been put together in summer 2009 during the time of the jubilee Song and Dance Celebration. The performance is an expansion of the short number &bdquo;Puu taga...\" (Behind the tree...) which brought the E.T.A. Dance Studio the Laureate title at the School Dance Festival 2009 (Koolitants in origin) in the contemporary dance category. The performance\'s initial version premiered on August 7, 2009 in Kingston, Jamaica, in the frames of the international dance conference where it received a storming applause. In conclusion, a short quote from Postimees daily by Mihkel Mutt (literary critic) that was published on July 15, 2009, around the time that the performance was being finalized: &bdquo;We are no tough free lords or bourgeois of the tenth generation, no romantic knights or great pirates who some of us have started to identify as in the meantime;, we are valets and saloon-keepers, parish clerks at best. We are the people whose inner backbone and greatest treasure is to come together after a long days work, blow the horn and sing, and thus cleanse and steel oneself.\"<br />Good luck in looking in the mirror!<br />Kristjan Kurm<br />(director of Estonian Dance Agency)</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>S&uuml;mpoosioni ajakava: <a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/203/\" target=\"_self\">http://www.saal.ee/event/203/</a><br />Toimub: Tallinna &Uuml;likooli Kunstide Instituudis / Lai 13 &amp; Kanuti Gildi SAALis / Pikk 20<br />Registreerumine: N 13.05 10:00-12:00, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, Pikk 20, Tallinn<br />Lisainfo ja eelregistreerimine: Heili Einasto heiein @ tlu.ee v&otilde;i Cid Pearlman cid.pearlman @ fulbrightmail.org<br />Foto: L.Wu<br />Toetajad: Kultuurkapital, Tallinn &Uuml;likool, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, U.S.A saatkond Tallinnas<br />Sissep&auml;&auml;s:<br />Pass: 300.- tagab sissep&auml;&auml;su k&otilde;igile &uuml;ritustele kolmel p&auml;eval eelregistreerumisel<br />Etendus&otilde;htud 13+14.04: 100.- &otilde;htu m&uuml;&uuml;gil Piletilevis<br />Tudengit&ouml;&ouml;d 14.04: 25.- saadaval pool tundi enne algust kohapeal</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',1,'','<p>Tallinna &Uuml;likooli Kunstide Instituudi Koreograafia osakonna s&uuml;mpoosioni etendus&otilde;htu:<br /><span class=\"keskmine\">ISABELLE KIROUAC, REBECCA PAPPAS, CID PEARLMAN, ALEXIS STEEVES, FINE5, ELO UNT</span></p>');

Her work is grounded both in the symbiotic relationship between process and product and in her collaborations with other artists.<br />A 2009 recipient of a Hothouse residency at UCLA and a 2007 recipient of a Silo Residency from DanceNOW/NYC, Rebecca has had her work produced in a variety of festivals and venues in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco including Deli Dances at Times Square, estrogenius at Manhattan Theatre Source, University Settlement, Access Theater, Highways Performance Space, Anatomy Riot, Under the Radar at High Energy Constructs, Studio at REDCAT and STREAM/fest at CounterPULSE. Rebecca has performed in works by Stephan Koplowitz, Yvonne Rainer, Denise Uyehara, Taisha Paggett, Carol McDowell, Cid Pearlman and Ana Maria Alvarez. Her bodywork, dancing and choreography are deeply influenced by her continuing studies with Barbara Mahler. She holds a B.A. in Dance and Sociology from Wesleyan University and an M.F.A. in Dance and Choreography from UCLA.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />The Surveillance Solos employ a combination of farce and stark honesty to question, in a world where so much information is easily accessible, just what can be considered private or intimate, and how quickly small deviations from \"normal\" behavior become suspicious. This excerpt, Surveillance Solo No. 4: Christine Suarez, imagines surveillance invading the innermost circle of privacy, positioning Christine\'s ex-husband as informant. As the male informant/agent reports on the mundane actions of Christine\'s morning routine, she moves in an ever-tightening spiral around him, performing folk-dance footwork and functional gestures. When she is out of the house, she inhabits a broader range of movement punctuated by her own internal rhythms and teeming emotion. Her actions are reported upon by a female agent who comes to identify with her subject\'s movements even as she informs on them. Christine\'s dancing through a projected profile alternately emphasizes and disappears pieces of her biography.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Sandra Chatterjee</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Cultivating an aesthetic that reflects the nomadic qualities of her life, Dr. (ucla) Sandra Chatterjee combines her interests of choreographing, writing, and organizing arts-related events/platforms. Sandra holds a PhD in Culture &amp; Performance (University of California, Los Angeles - UCLA), where she also taught as a visiting scholar. She also completed a diploma in \"Kultur und Organisation\" in Vienna. She is a cofounder of the Post Natyam Collective, a transnational network of independent choreographers/scholars, working in body based performance, video, and scholarship. In her scholarship, which has most recently been presented at \"Re-Searching Dance: International Conference on Dance Research\" (World Dance Alliance Asia/Pacific) in New Delhi and by ALF/CSCS, Bangalore (2009), she continually strives to intersect research, theorization and artistic practice. Sandra\'s training in Kuchipudi provides a foundation from which to create choreography, also drawing on her training in Bharatanatyam, Polynesian dance, modern/postmodern dance, and yoga. She received the Hawaii State dance Council\'s Choreographic Award and Cultural Preservation Award. Her professional experience includes solo performances in classical Indian dance as well as contemporary performance. She has, among others, worked with choreographers and artists Liz Lerman, Pichet Klunchun, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, and collaborated with Eko Supriyanto (Indonesia), Aditee Biswas (India), P.Senthilkumar (Austria). Her work (collaborative and solo) has been performed in Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic and India, e.g. at the prestigious THE OTHER FESTIVAL, Adhyaya and NATYA/STEM, Bangalore, at Neues Haus der Kammerspiele and Theatron, Munich, at Chandra-Mandapa-Spaces, Chennai, at V&ouml;lkerkunde Museum, Vienna, and at Tanzhaus NRW, D&uuml;sseldorf.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Using one dancer\'s body, video-projections, fragments of narrations and snap shots of the body, Self-portrait as Exotic releases female identity into fragments of movement and video, critically reflecting an exotifying gaze. Through a collage of video-projections, shadows, and varied movements vocabularies, tensions and oppositions, such as live-projected, south asian-european, viewer-viewed, will be played with. Self-portrait as Exotic has the choreographer/performer\'s experience as an \"Indian dancer\" of Bengali-German origin, living and dancing in Munich as a starting point. However, the piece unfolds as a coming together of fragments of stories, literature as well as autobiographical anecdotes. The presentation will be a coming together of speaking from the choreographic process, theorizing themes, and performing work-in-progress excerpts of movement, projection and text.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hana van der Kolk</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Hana van der Kolk was New York based (2001-2005) and Los Angeles-based (2005-2010) and is currently transient. Her choreographic projects combine elements of conceptual practice with the techniques of postmodern theater and choreography and take place in a wide range of sites. She is highly influenced by choreographer Deborah Hay whose dances she has<br />been learning and adapting since 2000. These solo adaptations, her collaborative adaptations with Layard Thompson and Jesse Johnson, as well as her own works have been presented in New York, New England, South Carolina, Berlin, Amsterdam, and throughout Southern<br />California. Hana has worked as a collaborator and consultant with many artists including Robby Herbst (reinterpretation of Alan Kaprow\'s Household, Museum of Contemporary Art/Outpost for Contemporary Art, Los Angeles), My Barbarian (The Case of the Stairs, Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Fourth Wall, MOCA, Los Angeles), and Jesse Aron Green (&Auml;rztliche Zimmergymnastik, The Tate Modern, London and the 2010 Whitney Biennial). She has performed in the work of Emily Mast, Rebecca Pappas, Dan Froot/Dan Hurlin, Cid Pearlman, and Bread and Puppet Theater. She was recently in residence at Sassafras in rural Tennessee and is currently in residence at AS220 in Providence, RI working on The Third Thing, a series of performance works about, for, and in collaboration with pairs of people with real life intimate relationships. Hana holds an MFA in choreography from UCLA and is a regular guest faculty member at the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Featuring music/text by Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam, Prince, Daft Punk and others, Once More draws from aspects of popular American (and global) culture to evoke familiar, even clich&eacute; narratives, while formal investigations of duration and repetition play with and against these clich&eacute; to examine intimacy, presence, and the cultivation and sharing of joy.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ana Flecha</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Ana Flecha has been presenting work for over a decade, recently receiving support from Dancer\'s Group and Theatre Bay Area, and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. Ana was the 2008 Artist in Residence at the Four Eighteen Project in Santa Cruz where she presented My American Dream, a multi media dance theater piece about American culture and identity. In the Spring of 2009 Ana performed with Kevin O\'Connor in his piece The Sunlight Zone, in California and Ontario, Canada, and she recently presented material from a new collaboration titled Anas in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She has performed with Cid Pearlman Performance Projects, Shah and Blah Productions, Frey Faust, Nita Little, Karl Schaffer, Therese Adams, Sharon Took-Zozaya, and was one of the original members of Mir &amp; a Co. aerial dance. Ana teaches classes based in Frey Faust\'s Axis Syllabus as well as contact improvisation locally and internationally. In March 2010 she co-directed the first Nomadic College month long training intensive based in the Axis Syllabus in Canoa Quebrada, Brazil, as well as teaching in Rio de Janeiro and Natal. Ana attended Tisch School of the Arts for dance at New York University, receiving her bachelors degree in 1995, and spent four years as part of the Chelsea Repertory LAB Company after graduation, performing and creating new work.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />The Red Queen, a multi-media solo originally excerpted from the evening length piece My American Dream, reflects on the mask of busy-ness in the lives of modern Americans. The woman in this piece is engaged in an ongoing race against time by the multi-tasking trappings of her daily schedule, which leaves her exactly where she started. Her metered drive is endlessly bracketed by the natural rhythms that govern the environment beyond her cubicle. The title of this piece is borrowed from the evolutionary theory that there is change but not necessarily progress, that progress is an invitation for defeat, and that existence does not get any easier. Evolutionists borrowed this term from the Red Queen in Alice and the Looking Glass, who runs like the wind but never gets anywhere.<br /> <br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tee Kuubis</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biography</span><br />Tee Kuubis (Tea/Do Cube) was created in spring 2005 by the students, teachers and alumni of the Department of Choreography, Tallinn University. The theatre helps to produce the performances of its members to show in public, offers technical support and searches for co-operations to have fresh experiences and processes. We have produced several dance performances mainly in contemporary dance, Estonian folk and stage dances (2/3 of our performances), medieval and renaissance dances. We are especially known for our site-specific thinking - we concentrate on space and time of every performance and try to \"feel\" the context. For site-specific projects the theatre was awarded the prize of the Breakthrough 2006 at Philip Morris Estonian Modern Dance Award distribution on 29 April 2006. Now already for more than 5 years tens of different projects/pieces and about 600 performing experiences have been organized and brought to the public. Theatre works on a project bases and has had the cooperation with Tallinn University, Estonian Concert, Estonian Open Air Museum, Historical music band Rondellus, Estonian Academy of Arts, Tallinn Art House, Enterprise Estonia, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, E-Theatre, Tallinn City Council and many other local institutions. Our members have been in the directing team of the big Estonian Dance Celebration already from the year 2004. We have also visited the dance <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">festivals in Greece and Romania in the years 2007-2009.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Project Description</span><br />Performance project \"Eestla\" The project was started in October 2009 to create a piece about Estonians as we feel ourselves in these days not as Estonians are named like for some time already. We do not think we are cold, sad and hurt. But we really are a bit ignorant. Is it because our reality is different and we still have too much work to do for our own homes? Or because we are used to survive? Or because we are lazy to analyze? Or because we are \"kilplased\" in our origin? Premiere of \"Eestla\" took place in November 2009 in Munich, Germany.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>S&uuml;mpoosioni ajakava: <a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/203/\" target=\"_self\">http://www.saal.ee/event/203/</a></p>\r\n<p>Toimub: Tallinna &Uuml;likooli Kunstide Instituudis / Lai 13 &amp; Kanuti Gildi SAALis / Pikk 20<br />Registreerumine: N 13.05 10:00-12:00, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, Pikk 20, Tallinn<br />Lisainfo ja eelregistreerimine: Heili Einasto heiein @ tlu.ee v&otilde;i Cid Pearlman cid.pearlman @ fulbrightmail.org<br />Foto: L.Wu<br />Toetajad: Kultuurkapital, Tallinn &Uuml;likool, Kanuti Gildi SAAL, U.S.A saatkond Tallinnas<br />Sissep&auml;&auml;s:<br />Pass: 300.- tagab sissep&auml;&auml;su k&otilde;igile &uuml;ritustele kolmel p&auml;eval eelregistreerumisel<br />Etendus&otilde;htud 13+14.04: 100.- &otilde;htu m&uuml;&uuml;gil Piletilevis<br />Tudengit&ouml;&ouml;d 14.04: 25.- saadaval pool tundi enne algust kohapeal</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',1,'','<p>Tallinna &Uuml;likooli Kunstide Instituudi Koreograafia osakonna s&uuml;mpoosioni etendus&otilde;htu:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"keskmine\">REBECCA ALSON-MILKMAN, SANDRA CHATTERJEE, HANA VAN DER KOLK, ANA FLECHA, TEE KUUBIS</span></p>');

Festival  on aastatega muutunud rahvusvaheliselt hinnatud s&uuml;gise alguse  tantsufestivaliks P&otilde;hjamaades ja kogu Euroopas, olles tuntuim kaasaegse  tantsu festival Eestis. Sel ja j&auml;rgmisel aastal kuulub festival Euroopa  kultuuripealinna Tallinn 2011 programmi.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Augusti TantsuFestival on sundimatus &otilde;hkkonnas toimuv professionaalne  tantsufestival, mis loob meeleolu nii osalejatele kui vaatajatele.  Selle-aastased etendused saavad teoks mitte ainult Kanuti Gildi SAALis,  vaid ka teistes Tallinna teatrites ning platsidel ja parkides. Festival  on m&otilde;eldud k&otilde;ige laiemale vaatajaskonnale. K&otilde;ik vabas &otilde;hus toimuvad  etendused on vaatajaile tasuta.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Selle-aastane Augusti TantsuFestival on p&uuml;hendatud Euroopa homsete  tippkoreograafide ja -tantsijate tegemistele. Juba j&auml;rgmine, 2011 toimuv  festival toob Tallinna taas tantsumaailma tipud. Lisaks Eesti oma  koreograafide v&otilde;ib festivalil n&auml;ha ka esinejaid Belgiast, Venemaalt,  Austriast, Hispaaniast, Rumeeniast ning Norrast. <br />T&auml;helepanuv&auml;&auml;rseks  saab kindlasti maailmakuulsa tantsukooli P.A.R.T.S. tudengite  &uuml;lesastumine Eestis. P.A.R.T.S. (Performing Arts Research and Training  Studios) on loodud tantsumaailma &uuml;he s&auml;ravama t&auml;he Anne Teresa De  Keersmaeker\'i poolt ning selle kooli l&otilde;petanud on hinnatud tantsijad ja  koreograafid. Rahvusvahelise tuuri k&auml;igus tutvustatakse publikule 24  tudengit 12-lt maalt ja 5-lt kontinendilt ning nende 4 aastat v&auml;ldanud  treeningprogrammi tulemust - isiklikku loomingut ja repertuaariprojekte.<br />Peale  oma tudengit&ouml;&ouml;de n&auml;idatakse ka Keersmaekeri enda poolt 1998. aastal  loodud lavastuse taaslavastust &bdquo;Re:Drumming\", Steve Reichi muusikale.  Kooli l&otilde;put&ouml;&ouml;de tuur on kutsutud osalema pea k&otilde;igile Euroopa  t&auml;htsamatele tantsufestivalidele.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tallinna linnaruumis (platsidel ja parkides) saab n&auml;ha aasta alguses  valminud julget ja kaasakiskuvat Mihkel Ernitsa tantsuetendust  &bdquo;Kehan&auml;ppajad\" ning noorte hispaania tantsijate tulist duetti &bdquo;VEN\".<br />&Uuml;kski  Augusti TantsuFestival ei ole saanud l&auml;bi &uuml;llatuseta. T&auml;navuse  festivali kavas on viimasel NYYD festivalil esietendunud Mart Kangro ja  Ansambel U: oman&auml;oline muusikaline lavastus &bdquo;Harmoonia\".</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tuntumatest kunstnikest oleme kohale kutsunud Norras elava iraanlase  Hooman Sharifi, kes oma &uuml;hiskondlikult teravate lavastustega ennegi  Eestis k&auml;inud. Seekordseks valikuks on tema viimane r&uuml;hmat&ouml;&ouml; &bdquo;Lingering  of an earlier event\".<br />&Uuml;le mitme aasta on Tallinnas taas n&auml;ha Rumeenia  kaasaegset tantsu. &Uuml;sna &uuml;llatusliku installatsioon-tantsulavastusega  telefoniputkas &uuml;llatab Vava Stefanescu.<br />Festivali l&otilde;puks oleme aga  kutsunud tujuk&uuml;llase dueti kahelt Venemaa koreograafilt-tantsijalt  (kellest &uuml;ks elab Viinis) &bdquo;Made in Russia\".<br />Kuna t&auml;navune Augusti  TantsuFestival on p&uuml;hendatud eelk&otilde;ige homsetele tipptegijatele  tantsumaailmas, on kavas ka &otilde;htu, kus saab n&auml;ha kolme noore Eesti  koreograafi - Ele Viskus, Liis Ilula, Henri H&uuml;tt - t&ouml;id. <br />Nad k&otilde;ik on  l&otilde;petanud T&Uuml; Viljandi Kultuuriakadeemia, kuid nende arusaam  tantsukunstist on p&otilde;nevalt erinev. Nendes t&ouml;&ouml;des paistab radikaalsemaid  otsinguid teemade ja vormi suhtes. Huumor pole neile tundmatu.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tantsufestival.ee/\" target=\"_blank\">www.tantsufestival.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Augusti TantsuFestival 2010 programm:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>L 14.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/232\" target=\"_self\"><strong>HOOMAN SHARIFI </strong>/NORRA/: \"Lingering of an earlier event\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>E 16.08 / 17:00 Vabaduse v&auml;ljak<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/233\" target=\"_self\"><strong>MIHKEL ERNITS </strong>/EESTI/: \"Kehan&auml;ppajad\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>E 16.08 / 20:00 Teater NO99<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/234\" target=\"_self\"><strong>P.A.R.T.S. / ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER</strong> /BELGIA/: \"RE: Drumming\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>T 17.08 / 20:00 Teater NO99<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/235\" target=\"_self\"><strong>P.A.R.T.S</strong>. /BELGIA/: personal work (l&otilde;petajate lavastused)</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>N 19.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/236\" target=\"_self\"><strong>LIIS ILULA</strong> /EEESTI/ \"&auml;lis mnimedemaal\"<br /><strong>ELE VISKUS</strong> /EESTI/ \"Taidlusr&uuml;hm R&auml;hn\"<br /><strong>HENRI H&Uuml;TT </strong>/EESTI/ \"The Reader\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>L 21.08 / 17:00 Kultuurikeskus Lindakivi tagune v&auml;ljak<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/237\" target=\"_self\"><strong>MIHKEL ERNITS</strong> /EESTI/: \"Kehan&auml;ppajad\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>E 23.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/238\" target=\"_self\"><strong>MART KANGRO &amp; ANSAMBEL U:</strong> /EESTI/: \"Harmoonia\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>T 24.08 / 18:00 Tammsaare park<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/239\" target=\"_self\"><strong>LA MACANA</strong> /HISPAANIA/: \"VEN\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>K 25.08 / 18:00 Kino S&otilde;prus esine<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/240\" target=\"_self\"><strong>LA MACANA</strong> /HISPAANIA/: \"VEN\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>K 25.08 / 20:00 Von Krahli Teater<a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/241\" target=\"_self\"><br /><strong>VAVA STEFANESCU</strong> /RUMEENIA/: \"Quartet for a microphone\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>N 26.08 / 20:00 Von Krahli Teater<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/241\" target=\"_self\"><strong>VAVA STEFANESCU</strong> /RUMEENIA/: \"Quartet for a microphone\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>R 27.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/242\" target=\"_self\"><strong>OLEG SULIMENKO &amp; ANDREI ANDRIANOV</strong> /VENEMAA-AUSTRIA/: \"Made in Russia\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>L 28.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><a href=\"http://www.saal.ee/event/242\" target=\"_self\"><strong>OLEG SULIMENKO &amp; ANDREI ANDRIANOV</strong> /VENEMAA-AUSTRIA/: \"Made in Russia\"</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Augusti TantsuFestival 2010 team:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Priit  Raud, Eneli J&auml;rs, Annika &Uuml;prus, Mairika Plakso, Revo Koplus, Kristjan  Suits, Krista Jakobson, Risto Kalmre, Hanna Tiidus, Timo Toots, Taavi  &bdquo;Miisu\" Varm.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Augusti TantsuFestival 2010 saab teoks t&auml;nu partneritele/toetajatele:</strong></span><br />Eesti  Kultuuriministeerium, Eesti Kultuurkapital, Hasartm&auml;ngumaksu N&otilde;ukogu,  Tallinna Kultuuriv&auml;&auml;rtuste Amet, SA Tallinn 2011, Hispaania suursaatkond  Eestis, Kuninglik Norra Saatkond, Flaami kultuuriministeerium/Belgia,  festival Baltoscandal, Von Krahli Teater, CRAMO, Vichy Classique ning  Sokos Hotel Viru.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Augusti TantsuFestival 2010 piletid:</strong></span><br />Piletid  m&uuml;&uuml;gil kuni 8. augustini soodushinnaga 80/125 EEK (5.11/7.98 EUR),  alates 9. augustist hinnaga 110/160 EEK (7.03/10.23 EUR) m&uuml;&uuml;gil  Piletilevi / www.piletilevi.ee m&uuml;&uuml;gikohtades ning pool tundi enne algust  kohapeal.<br />Festivali passid 410/600 EEK (26.20/38.34 EUR) (sissep&auml;&auml;s  k&otilde;igile etendustele) ja 235/375 EEK (15.01/23.96 EUR) (sissep&auml;&auml;s neljale  vabalt valitud etendusele) on m&uuml;&uuml;gil ainult 8. augustini Piletilevi  m&uuml;&uuml;gikohtades.</p>\r\n<p>*Kanuti Gildi SAALi etendused ei ole m&otilde;eldud v&auml;ikestele lastele, kui ei ole m&auml;rgitud teisiti.<br />*Kanuti Gildi SAALi etendustele HILINEJAD sisse ei p&auml;&auml;se!<br />*Korraldajad j&auml;tavad endile &otilde;iguse muudatuste tegemiseks.

Tihti on reaktsioonid tema etendustele olnud emotsionaalsed. Aastaid tagasi tegi kultuurilehe ajakirjanik ettepaneku kuulutada Sharifi \"persona non-grataks\" Eestis!?</p>\r\n<p><br />Iraani p&auml;ritolu koreograafi viimane lavastus avab meile kujuteldava maa, kus aja kvaliteedil on eriline t&auml;htsus. See on maa, mis ei ole veel t&otilde;eluseks saanud, kuigi samas tundub, et on alati olemas olnud. Maa, mis veel peab tulema, kuigi tegelikult oli olemas juba kaua aega tagasi. Sest aega on selles riigis k&uuml;lluses - koos elamine on inimestele &uuml;ks paljudest v&otilde;imalustest eksisteerimiseks. Kuna inimene on alati avatud paljudele v&otilde;imalikele tegevustele, v&otilde;ivad inimesed koos elada pidevates lahkarvamustes, kuid sellest hoolimata v&otilde;ivad nad lasta ka probleemil eksisteerida seni, kuni parim lahendus iseenesest selgub. Selles l&otilde;pmatute v&otilde;imaluste riigis leiavad elanike vahelised kohtumised aset seet&otilde;ttu, et nad keelduvad radikaalselt igasugustest muutustest. Etendus uurib selle kujuteldava ajarohke maa kehastunud suhteid ning viise, kuidas kehade jaotus keeldub muutusest, et teha elu v&otilde;imalikuks. Koos sellega luuakse publikule v&otilde;imalus kujutleda, milline oleks k&uuml;llusliku ajaga maa, kus liikumine ei s&otilde;ltu &uuml;ksnes muutustest.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hooman Sharifi t&ouml;&ouml;des on alati tunda v&otilde;imsat f&uuml;&uuml;silist j&otilde;udu.

Poliitika t&auml;hendab seejuures tema jaoks sotsiaalset taju ja kohustust, kuid ilma pealiskaudsete anal&uuml;&uuml;sideta ja kergesti loetavate esitusteta, mis on eeldatavalt poliitilistel teemadel.

Teda on alati huvitanud tantsu ja teatri piirialad ning peale kooli l&otilde;ppu on taema t&ouml;&ouml;d olnud nii teatraalsed kui visuaalselt haaravad. 2000.a. l&otilde;i ta kompanii - Impure Company.

Lisaks k&otilde;igev&otilde;imsamale armastab ta jalgpalli ja oma suurep&auml;rast argentiinlannast katoliiklasest naist Renatat. Igal &otilde;htul enne magama minekut peab ta hilist hommikueinet, mis koosneb Dalmatian Prosciutto singist, ahjus k&uuml;psetatud saiast ja m&otilde;nest heast klaasist kodusest mustast veinist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vanja Vascarac</strong> on k&uuml;ps X generatsiooni liige ja &otilde;rn k&uuml;&uuml;nik, kelle maailm k&otilde;igub osav&otilde;tmatu naiivsuse ja julma paranoilisuse vahel.

Dean Kriva&#269;i&#263;, Sven Jakir and Miran Kurspahi&#263; are on the stage talking about their work and questioning themselves about the best way to represent Croatia. In the well known Kurspahi&#263; method of activating the auditorium, the audience was given a role of international producers (all of us got a calling card of the actors), and provoked about their questionable sexuality and nationality (we all know that gays and jews rock the theatre world). The final scene emphasizes the form of a political cabaret; Dean Kriva&#269;i&#263; sings Danke Dautschland, dressed in both Croatian and German flag. There is a glove hanging from his behind. And guess what sign is on the glove. The yellow European stars.<br />Iva Grui&#263;, Jutarnji list</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em>Kurspahi&#263; &amp; ?ulj successfully developed a selfironizing, provocative but also very manipulative performance with lots of parody. Geography victims is a witty and delightful patchwork formed in mildly Monty Python style, a story about Croatia and her European future...<br />Helena Braut, Vjesnik</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br />Geography victims - a commercial. Though not for Croatia but for authors themselves... Whie actors on stage try to sell themselves to the audience, the main objectives comes to the surface; from the concrete ones like geographical position, well known tourist locations, gastronomic menu etc actors lead us all the way to fully understanding Balcanian mentality; true emotions are introduced and revealed through singing and dancing. Structurally, performance is consisted of numerous closed episodes dealing with theatrical and metatheatrical inquestioning of the theatre act itself. Actors test different methods of acting and actions on the stage; they use classic narration, story telling, mine and many more. The content of the episodes goes from strictly informational to some very playful and humorous demonstrations, like the one of Croatian folklore followed by great video presentation of literature used for making the scene. In this highly physical performance, actors are crossing the borders of the stage and mingle with the public offering them cheese and ham, Croatian &scaron;ljivovica and are in constant search for a producer. Behind all of the humour and wittiness, and the end, lies the truth about our preeuropean reality and a very well formed critique of political and social bearers of the country. I think I can predict a good box office result to Geography victims.<br />Igor Tretinjak</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em>A junction of stand up comedy and pure ritual pleasure, a good form for presenting domestic mentality. Kurspahi&#263; and ?ulj are playing with the clich&eacute;, presenting the beautiness of Croatian shore and Balkan excitement while singing, shouting and shooting, they are opening important questions about Croatia as a part of the European Union. Kurspahi&#263; is, as always, slightly auto-ironic when in search for a better \"European\" producer. Well, judging by the number of his work that Theatre &amp;TD produced through past seasons, it seems that he has found one. Fortunately for the Croatian theatre scene which screams for diversity. Even if it was a bit narcistic and infantile.<br />Igor Ru?8i&#263;, Radio 101</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EESTI PRESS:</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?0&amp;popup=video&amp;id=35976\" target=\"_blank\">AK</a> (alates 22:23) / ERR 17.09.2010</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/583709\" target=\"_blank\">Kanuti gildi saalis m&ouml;llab Hotvaatia moodne teater</a> - Tiiu Laks / Eesti P&auml;evaleht 17.09.2010</p>',1,'','<p><span class=\"suur\">MIRAN KURSPAHIC &amp; RONA ZULJ </span>/Horvaatia/</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"keskmine\">\"Geography victims 2: return of the victim\"</span></p>');

Vahel on olnud katseid sellest eemalduda. Saada t&auml;iskasvanuks. Olla iseseisev. L&otilde;hkuda. Teha asju teistmoodi. Puberteediiga on m&ouml;&ouml;das ja taas on leitud tee lapsep&otilde;lvekoju, kust k&otilde;ik alguse sai. <br />ZUGA on tantsukompanii, mis on olemas ainult siis, kui ZUGA seda v&auml;ga tahab. Selleks ei piisa &uuml;he inimese tahtest v&otilde;i ponnistustest. Aastal 1999 me tahtsime v&auml;ga. Meri oli p&otilde;lvini. Ka Eesti Vabariik oli uus ja avatud. Andsime etendusi New Yorgis, San Diegos, Jekaterinburgis, Saksamaal, Rumeenias, Hollandis ja mujal. Hea Ameerika onu Soros toetas meie tegevust. Me olime t&auml;htsad. <br />Perioodil 2006 - 2010 tegutsesid ZUGA liikmed eraldi. Iga&uuml;ks tegi sellist t&ouml;&ouml;d, mida tema isiklikult k&otilde;ige rohkem soovis v&otilde;i paremaks pidas. Reise j&auml;i j&auml;rjest v&auml;hemaks. Samuti toetusi. Maailm muutus kitsamaks.<br />2010 tekkis k&otilde;igil korraga soov koguneda. Uuesti kogeda seda grupit&ouml;&ouml; v&otilde;lu ja valu. Aru saada, mis on juhtunud vahepeal nii meie isiklikus maailmavaates kui ka laiemas kultuuripildis. <br />ZUGA puhul ei ole keegi t&auml;htsam kui teine. N&uuml;&uuml;d, kus vanus l&auml;heneb 40-le, ei ole enam reegel ka see, et kes k&otilde;vemini karjub, selle m&otilde;tted on &otilde;igemad. Hakkasime uuesti looma reegleid, milleta ei ole koost&ouml;&ouml; v&otilde;imalik. Kokkuleppeid, mis ei ole kompromissid. See aga on pagana raske. T&ouml;&ouml;d tehes tekkis tihti tunne, et &auml;kki on mitte kunagi parem kui hilja.<br />N&uuml;&uuml;d, kus esietenduseni on v&auml;he j&auml;&auml;nud, v&otilde;ime &ouml;elda, et see on v&otilde;imalik ja see on &auml;ge.\" <br /><br /><strong>ZUGA &uuml;hendatud tantsijad</strong> on tantsukollektiiv, mis loodi 11 aastat tagasi tol ajal noorte ja aktiivsete tantsutegijate Tiina M&ouml;lderi, Kaja Kannu ja Jarmo Karingu poolt.

Augusti l&otilde;pus on ootamas kaks n&auml;dalat t&auml;is eriilmelisi lavastusi nii Tallinn teatrites kui t&auml;navatel alustades kohalikest tegijatest ja l&otilde;petades k&uuml;lalistega Jaapanist. Augusti TantsuFestival pole kunagi kartnud &uuml;letada stereot&uuml;&uuml;pe, neid kas v&otilde;i j&otilde;uga l&otilde;hkudes. Sellest erinev pole kava ka sellel aastal: hiilides, kavaldades, surudes v&otilde;i tantsides lammutavad festivali esinejad piire tantsukunsti ning muude kunstiliikide vahel. Taaskord on eesm&auml;rgiks panna publik imestama, r&otilde;&otilde;mustama, vihkama ja m&otilde;tisklema etendustel nii Tallinna teatrites kui t&auml;navatel.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 piletim&uuml;&uuml;k algab 15. juunil, mil m&uuml;&uuml;ki l&auml;hevad:</span></strong><br />-&uuml;ksikpiletid etendustele soodushinnaga 5/8 EUR kuni 07.08 ja alates 08.08 on &uuml;ksikpiletid hinnaga 8/11 EUR Piletimaailmas ja Piletilevis<br />-piiratud koguses FESTIVALI PASSE hinnaga 25/50 EUR, festivali pass tagab sissep&auml;&auml;su k&otilde;igile festivali &uuml;ritustele, saadaval Piletilevis kuni 8.augustini<br />-piiratud koguses FESTIVALI V&Auml;IKESI PASSE hinnaga 15/24 EUR, mis &nbsp;tagavad sissep&auml;&auml;su 4-le etendusele, mida saab osta ainult Piletilevi kassadest ning sobivad etendused tuleb v&auml;lja valida koha peal, saadaval kuni 8.augustini</p>\r\n<p>*soodustus kehtib &otilde;pilastele, &uuml;li&otilde;pilastele ja pension&auml;ridele!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 programm:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>15.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /><strong>GUNILLA HEILBORN </strong>/Stockholm/: <strong>This Is Not A Love Story</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>16.08 / 20:00 Eesti Rahvusraamatukogu amfiteater<br /><strong>MIHKEL ERNITS &amp; LAURA KVELSTEIN</strong> /Tallinn/: <strong>It was good while it lasted</strong> (feat.

Oma obsessiivse ringliikumise singulaarsuse sees juurutab Daniel Linehan tervet rida variatsioone, kiirenemisi ja vaevu tajutavaid nihkeid, luues naljaka ning keeruka tantsu. Ta allutab end pingelistele f&uuml;&uuml;silistele ja vaimsetele protsessidele, mis h&otilde;lmavad mitmeid samaaegseid &uuml;lesandeid: ta k&otilde;neleb, m&otilde;tleb, reageerib, p&ouml;&ouml;rdub publiku poole jne, kuid ei peata kordagi oma pidevat p&ouml;&ouml;rlemist. Linehan &uuml;tleb meile, et ta ei r&auml;&auml;gi meeleheitest, vastupidavusest ega valitsuse poliitikast; ta ei r&auml;&auml;gi kuulsustest, virtuoossusest ega metaf&uuml;&uuml;silistest probleemidest. Ent, kuigi tema s&otilde;nad n&auml;evad seda eitavat, juhib ta meie t&auml;helepanu just nendele k&uuml;simustele, mis kutsuvad ellu m&auml;rksa suurema maailma kui tema piiratud, pisike ring. Daniel Linehan p&ouml;&ouml;rleb l&otilde;putult nihkuva ideede v&otilde;rgustiku keskme &uuml;mber ja loob tagurpidi musta augu, mis on vahest peadp&ouml;&ouml;ritav ruum, kuid samas ka paik rahulikuks m&otilde;tiskluseks, kus k&otilde;ik need m&otilde;tted v&otilde;ivad kulgeda ja kajada.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Idee ja teostus: Daniel Linehan</p>\r\n<p>Originaalvalgus: Joe Levasseur</p>\r\n<p>Dramaturgia: Juliette Mapp</p>\r\n<p>&bdquo;Not About Everything\" loodi osaliselt t&auml;nu programmidele Bessie Sch&ouml;nberg/ First Light Commissioning Program ja Creative Residency Program of Dance Theater Workshop ning seda toetasid Jerome Foundation, Ford Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts (USA f&ouml;deraalagentuur), New Yorgi osariigi kunstin&otilde;ukogu ja Jerome Robbins Foundation.

Maailm muutus kitsamaks. 2010 tekkis k&otilde;igil korraga soov koguneda. Uuesti kogeda seda grupit&ouml;&ouml; v&otilde;lu ja valu. Aru saada, mis on juhtunud vahepeal nii meie isiklikus maailmavaates kui ka laiemas kultuuripildis.&nbsp; ZUGA puhul ei ole keegi t&auml;htsam kui teine. Hakkasime uuesti looma reegleid, milleta ei ole koost&ouml;&ouml; v&otilde;imalik. Kokkuleppeid, mis ei ole kompromissid. See aga on pagana raske.

INSERT INTO `saal_events_et` VALUES (370,'','<p>\"my name is I LOVE YOU\" on l&uuml;his&otilde;naline armastuslugu. Me k&otilde;ik vajame kedagi, kelle vastu tunda tugevaid tundeid - tahame seda v&otilde;i ei. See kirjeldab kogu lavastust ja, kuigi ta v&otilde;ib olla lapsik, r&auml;&auml;gib lugu hirmust, mida me tunneme armastuse poole liikudes.</p>\r\n<p>Loo l&otilde;pp pole aga t&otilde;sine, seep&auml;rast proovime kujutada seda totakalt. Meie jaoks pole totakas negatiivne s&otilde;na. Ilma totakuse ja &otilde;nneliku suhtumiseta oleksime &uuml;sna tundetud.</p>\r\n<p>Esietenduse ajal otsisime meile sobivat n&auml;itlemisviisi. J&auml;rsku m&otilde;istsime, et Kitagawa tahtis meis lavastamise k&auml;igus lahutada k&otilde;nelevat ja liikuvat n&auml;itlejat ning see avas ootamatult ukse totakale stiilile.</p>\r\n<p>K&otilde;neleja ja liikuja vahel on l&otilde;he. Meie kasutame seda l&otilde;het selleks, et olla v&otilde;imalikult totakad ja naljakad ning r&auml;&auml;kida armastusest, mida tuleks jagada universaalselt, kuid mida tuleks ka teadlikult m&otilde;testada.</p>\r\n<p>N&uuml;&uuml;disteatri trupp faifai (varem Koyubichi) asutas 2004. aastal Yon Kitagawa, kes oli t&uuml;dinud teiste poolt m&auml;&auml;ratud korduvatest, kopitanud standarditest ja normidest ning soovis laiendada piire ja otsida uusi alasid, mida polnud teatrikunstis veel n&auml;htud, segades teatrit jaapani popkultuuriga. Sellest ajast peale on trupp olnud aktiivne osaleja Tokyo erksas teatrimaailmas, andes sellesse oma panuse ainulaadse perspektiivi ja lavastuste &otilde;hustike n&auml;ol.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Faifai vaatleb maailma sarkastiliselt ja tundlikult ning esitab oma lugusid huumori ja s&uuml;mpaatiaga. Nende loomisviis h&otilde;lmab palju eksperimenteerimist ja improviseerimist ning selle tulemuseks on loomulik m&auml;ng, mis paljastab n&auml;itlejate isiksusi. P&otilde;him&otilde;tteliselt keskendub enamik nende teostest armastusele ja suhetele, inimlikele joontele, mis on levinud &uuml;le kogu maailma. Teisest k&uuml;ljest kujutavad nad sageli ka Jaapanile eriomaseid sotsiaalseid n&auml;htusi, n&auml;idates &uuml;hiskonda &uuml;likriitilise, ent samas mittevaenuliku ja neile ainulaadselt omase humoorika stiiliga. Ehkki nende lood p&auml;rinevad ennek&otilde;ike igap&auml;evaelust, annab esitusviis lugudele rikkaliku sisu. Liikumisse ja lavastusse pikitud tantsustseenide ning keerukate visuaal- ja heliv&otilde;tete kaudu muudab faifai oma lavastused ka &uuml;limalt esteetiliseks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Trupp on teinud koost&ouml;&ouml;d kunstnikega erinevatest valdkondadest ja loonud mitmeid ruumip&otilde;hiseid teoseid. Kuigi faifai on v&auml;ga noor trupp ja alles oma karj&auml;&auml;ri alguses, on nende tegevus p&auml;lvinud &uuml;ha rohkem huvi ja populaarsust nii Jaapanis kui mujal. Viimastel aastatel on nende t&ouml;&ouml;d tunnustatud mitmete auhindadega nii teatrite kui muude organisatsioonide poolt. Tulevikus plaanib trupp laiendada oma tegevust eksperimenteerides erinevate kunstidega ning ka l&auml;bi koost&ouml;&ouml; ja etendustega v&auml;lisriikides.\r\n<script src=\"http://www.saal.ee/ohjur/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FAI-FAIst l&uuml;hidalt: See 2004. aastal asutatud ja Tokyos paiknev trupp koosneb 10 tuumikliikmest, kuid teeb sageli koost&ouml;&ouml;d laiema hulga artistidega. Faifai &uuml;ritab pelgalt teatri- ja tantsulavastuste tootmise asemel luua nauditavaid s&uuml;ndmusi, mis &uuml;hendaks publikut jagatud kogemuse ning &otilde;hustiku kaudu. Trupp kaasab sageli elemente meie igap&auml;evaelust ja t&otilde;stab neid popkunstilikul viisil &uuml;mber, t&auml;ites lugusid faifai &otilde;nneliku auraga. Nende eufooriline t&ouml;&ouml; k&auml;sitleb t&auml;nap&auml;eva &uuml;hiskonna keerukust ja esindab linna ning selles elavate inimeste visadust. Faifai on viimasel ajal saanud t&auml;helepanu ka rahvusvahelisel areenil ning neid on kutsutud esinema erinevatele s&uuml;ndmustele teisel pool ookeani.

Ei, &Scaron;veitsi videokunstniku Pipilotti Risti deb&uuml;&uuml;tfilm ei ole tavaline loop&otilde;hine teos.&nbsp; See ei ole puhta kino eksperiment, vaid intermeedialine kunstiteos, mis kombineerib enesesse erinevaid v&otilde;tteid filmikunstist, animatsioonist ja videokunstist, luues sellega unikaalse v&auml;rvilise universumi, mida v&auml;ljaspool Risti loomingut ei ole v&otilde;imalik kogeda. Uue ja unikaalse maailma kogemise v&otilde;imalus ongi filmi deviisiks, mis p&otilde;hjendab nii kujutatut kui ka kujutamise viisi.

Ta on &otilde;ppinud Viinis ja Baselis. 1997. aastal esitleti tema t&ouml;id ka Venezia Biennaalil, kus ta p&auml;lvis Premio 2000 auhinna.

Each aspect is designed, developed and realised by the FIT<br />Festival  Directors as part of the programme of the hosting festivals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FESTIVAL LAB is a project in three steps for one year.<br />o  Following a European-wide call, 20 participants will be chosen to take  part in the project.<br />o All selected participants will attend the five  day academy combining theoretical and<br />practical work.<br />o The  participants will attend a minimum of five three day workshops at the  eight<br />participating FIT festivals.<br />o Following the academy, on the  basis of their programme proposals, five selected<br />participants will  be offered a residency (up to 6 months) at one of the five coordinating<br />FIT  Festivals, where they will further develop and realise their project.  This project will<br />then be presented as part of the hosting  international festival.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the Academy and Workshops international travel and  accommodation of the 20 selected<br />participants will be covered, but  not daily living costs. For the Residencies international<br />travel,  accommodation and basic living costs will be covered.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Alongside providing an opportunity for future festival  directors and producers, FESTIVAL<br />LAB\'s pioneering initiative aims to  promote and explore fresh and contemporary<br />programming ideas to  European audiences and sector professionals. It will facilitate the<br />sharing  of knowledge in the field of festival management and create an informal  network, as<br />well as enabling debate and transformation around  supporting and developing new talent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FESTIVAL LAB was born out of Festivals in Transition, a  network founded in 2005 that has<br />successfully implemented two  large-scale projects (theatre-fit.org). FESTIVAL LAB is a<br />collaboration  between the festivals SPIELART - Munich (DE), BALTIC CIRCLE - Helsinki<br />(FI),  KRAKOWSKIE REMINISCENCJE TEATRALNE (KRT) - Krakow (PL), HOMO NOVUS -  Riga<br />(LV) and LIFT - The London International Festival of Theatre -  London (GB).

Oma &uuml;he-mehe-show\'s \"Rede/Speech\" uurib Blixa Bargeld keele ja muusika vahelisi piire. Publik on tunnistajaks, kuidas laused, s&otilde;nad ja silbid muunduvad akustiliseks arhitektuuriks, vastuk&otilde;lavateks sf&auml;&auml;rideks ja kakofoonilisteks monstrumiteks. Tegu pigem performance-kunsti teosega kui kontserdi v&otilde;i teatrietendusega. Improvisatsiooni k&auml;igus astub Bargeld publikuga dialoogi, k&uuml;sides k&uuml;simusi, millele ta ootab sama ausaid vastuseid nagu on ta enda olek laval, mis on kompromissitult haavatav ja aus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tehnilised vahendid on taandatud miinimumini: mikrofonid, efektiseadmed ja jalapedaalid, helimonitorid ja kaks valjuh&auml;&auml;ldit ja miksimispult teisel pool lava, mille taga istub Boris Wilsdorf. Vaid k&otilde;ige selle abiga loob Blixa Bargeld lihtsast lausest v&otilde;i pelgalt s&otilde;nadest keeruka helitekstuuri, kasutades peamise vahendina vaid iseenda h&auml;&auml;lt. Etenduse alguses toimub l&uuml;hike tehnilise aparatuuri tutvustus ja demonstreerimine. Seel&auml;bi muutub improvisatsiooniprotsess teose struktuuri l&auml;bipaistvaks osaks. N&auml;ib, et mingisuguseid varjatud trikke ei olegi. Kuid intelligentne meelelahutus, millesse Blixa Bargeld oma kuulajad sisse veab omandab erilise d&uuml;naamilisuse ja intensiivsuse. L&uuml;hike sissepiilumine vokaalalkeemiku laboratooriumisse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Blixa Bargeld</strong> on s&uuml;ndinud 1959. aastal Berliinis. 1980. aastast on grupi Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten asutajaliige ja esilaulja. 1984-2003 kitarrist grupis Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

Kogu ettev&otilde;tmine kulmineerub aastal 2011 lavastusega, kus keskset rolli m&auml;ngib inimeste ja masinate vaheline energia - muunduv, tekkiv, kaduv ja taastekkiv. R&uuml;hmituse liige Taavet Jansen kirjeldab projekti n&otilde;nda: \"Esinejad, tehnikud ja publik loovad koos energiamulli, mis l&otilde;puks kaob plaksatusega &ouml;he.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>S&otilde;ltumatu uurimusgrupp MIMproject astus s&uuml;gisel 2009 v&otilde;itlusse ressursse raiskava teatridinosaurusega - unistuseks tehnoloogiline teater, mille kunstiline v&auml;&auml;rtus ei s&otilde;ltuks Eesti Energia seinakontaktist saadavast elektrienergiast. \"MIM goes sustainable\" ei taha olla pelgalt j&auml;rjekordne rohelise rahulipu lehvitamine kapitalistliku &uuml;hiskonna painajate poole, et oma s&uuml;dametunnistust puhastada tuleviku teatrispektaaklite p&auml;rast. Hoopist&uuml;kis uuritakse ja arendatakse palju isiklikumat suhet energia, teatri ja publiku vahel. Vaimse energia jagamine ja vahetamine l&auml;bi teatrimaagia on k&otilde;igile ammu tuttav teema, kuid millegiparast l&auml;heb ikka veel etendajate ja publiku f&uuml;&uuml;siline energia lihtsalt teatrimaja ventilatsioonisahti. N&otilde;nda keskenduvadki loojad probleemile, kuidas f&uuml;&uuml;silisest energiast saaks vaimne, spirituaalne energia selle k&otilde;ige lihtsamas t&auml;henduses ning kuidas see j&auml;lle f&uuml;&uuml;siliseks energiaks tagasi p&ouml;&ouml;rata, et tekiks isetoitev s&otilde;ltumatu energiaring.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oma j&auml;rjekordses showingus ehitab vapper MIMproject meeskond Kunstihoone ette, Vabaduse v&auml;ljakule iseseisva peokonteineri (Self Sustainable Party Container). Peokonteineri algidee on v&auml;ljendada s&otilde;ltumatust k&otilde;ikv&otilde;imalikest takistustest, millega kunstnik ja tema t&ouml;&ouml; pidevalt rinda pistma peab - alates kunstiruumi puudumisest, energiast ja vahenditest. Selleks on MIMproject ehitanud endale oma \'galerii\', oma \'elektrij&otilde;ujaama\' ja pea kogu vajaminev tehnika on &uuml;mberehitatud pr&uuml;gi. Konteiner on liikuv galerii ja j&otilde;ujaama mootoriteks aktiivsed ja uudishimulikud linnakodanikud - need, kes soovivad teada, mitu kilovattundi nende kontidesse peidetud on; keda huvitavad seosed energia, heli ja valguse vahel; v&otilde;i need, kes soovivad lihtsalt pidutseda isem&auml;ngiv automaatb&auml;nd taustaks. \"Self Sustainable Party Container\" esimese versiooni avamine toimus m&auml;rtsis 2010 Helsingis PixelAche festivali raames, koost&ouml;&ouml;s Soome kunstnike r&uuml;hmitusega  Association of experimental electronics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>MIMproject meeskond:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Maike Lond</strong> - muusik, interdistsiplinaarne kunstnik, l&otilde;petanud ArtScience eriala Haagi Kuninglikus Akadeemias.

Kolmandaks faasiks on originaallavastus, mis koondab endasse eelneva kahe faasi jooksul kogunenud materjali, valimiseelse propaganda, parteide valimisprogrammid, autorite kommentaarid ja \"terve m&otilde;istuse h&auml;&auml;le\". \"Kolm v&auml;rvi.

Each aspect is designed, developed and realised by the FIT Festival Directors as part of the programme of the hosting festivals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FESTIVAL LAB is a project in three steps for one year.<br />o Following a European-wide call, 20 participants will be chosen to take part in the project.<br />o All selected participants will attend the five day academy combining theoretical and practical work.<br />o The participants will attend a minimum of five three day workshops at the eight participating FIT festivals.<br />o Following the academy, on the basis of their programme proposals, five selected participants will be offered a residency (up to 6 months) at one of the five coordinating FIT Festivals, where they will further develop and realise their project. This project will then be presented as part of the hosting international festival.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the Academy and Workshops international travel and accommodation of the 20 selected participants will be covered, but not daily living costs.

Art show on ajakohane visuaalm&otilde;tiskluste jada, mille keskmes on vaatenurkade paljusus. Kontseptuaalsele t&uuml;hjustundele kunstis eelistame detailiderohkust, omam&uuml;toloogiat, &otilde;hulosse, asjade &otilde;igete nimedega nimetamist, intensiivsust, otseseid vihjeid, k&auml;rsitult pillavat suhtumist, marketingi ja antilokaalsust.<br />Art shows kujuneb praktilisusest visuaalse ilu sf&auml;&auml;r. Keha t&auml;idab laval mitmek&uuml;lgse &uuml;tlemise funktsiooni, milles kalkuleeritus j&auml;&auml;b emotsiooni varju. Sammu v&auml;ljendus on olulisem kui selle j&auml;lgimine. Samas saab keha k&auml;sitleda kui vahendajat, mis ei koonda endale kogu t&auml;helepanutervikut, vaid osutab lavamaastiku muudele osistele. Staatilisus ei viita t&uuml;hjusele, vaid r&uuml;tmile ruumis, milles keha asub. D&uuml;naamilisus ei viita t&otilde;estamisvajadusele, vaid totaalsele ruumile.<br />Art shows peab publik usaldama ka rekvisiitide ja kunstniku vahelist r&uuml;tmi, milles silm paneb ise loo kokku. Pinge moodustub visuaalkomponentide omavahelisest suhtest. Kunstnik-k&auml;ivitaja positsioon on aimatav mitte eeldatav.<br />Art show m&otilde;jub ruumis justkui eklektiline legend, milles vaataja &uuml;lesanne on tarbida v&otilde;imalikult palju visuaalset materjali. Struktuuri irratsionaalsus muudab piltide vaheldumise intensiivseks ja detailiderohkeks. Dekoratsioonide hingestatus t&auml;histab art shows peale illustreeriva elemendi ka kunstniku k&auml;epikenduse funktsiooni lavaruumis. Lavakujundusest saab art shows skulpturaalne element, mille eesm&auml;rk on ruumi m&otilde;&otilde;tmeid estetiseerida.

Liikumine isiklikust inimkaugeni ja vastupidi.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>K&otilde;ige paremini iseloomustab toimuvat noorte kunstnike poolt koostatud art show manifest:<br />&bdquo;Art show on loo jutustamise viis, mille taotlus on visuaalse m&otilde;tlemise muutus etenduskunstides. Eklektilisus on kujunemas &uuml;heks oluliseks vaatamiskriteeriumiks etenduses ja meie eesm&auml;rk on seda protsessi propageerida. Meie sihtgrupp on v&auml;&auml;rtuseid &uuml;mberhindamisv&otilde;imeline vaataja, kes annab v&otilde;imaluse populaarkultuuri poeesiale laval.<br />P&otilde;lvnemine ja j&auml;rgnevus kunstiajaloos on iseenesestm&otilde;istetavad, milles rajaleidja art show p&uuml;&uuml;ab etendust t&otilde;lgendades v&auml;ltida olemasolevatele ?anritele toetumist. Etenduskunste koondaval lineaarsel teljel on art show eesm&auml;rk suuna- ja t&auml;hendusmuutus. Meie looming ei pretendeeri mitte mineviku v&auml;&auml;rtuste hoidmisele, vaid nende uutele t&auml;hendustele ajas milles elame.<br />Meie poolt esindatud v&auml;&auml;rtuss&uuml;steemil kunstis ei ole palju &uuml;hist eelneva loogikaga info edastamises laval. Art show on ajakohane visuaalm&otilde;tiskluste jada, mille keskmes on vaatenurkade paljusus. Kontseptuaalsele t&uuml;hjustundele kunstis eelistame detailiderohkust, omam&uuml;toloogiat, &otilde;hulosse, asjade &otilde;igete nimedega nimetamist, intensiivsust, otseseid vihjeid, k&auml;rsitult pillavat suhtumist, marketingi ja antilokaalsust.<br />Art shows kujuneb praktilisusest visuaalse ilu sf&auml;&auml;r. Keha t&auml;idab laval mitmek&uuml;lgse &uuml;tlemise funktsiooni, milles kalkuleeritus j&auml;&auml;b emotsiooni varju. Sammu v&auml;ljendus on olulisem kui selle j&auml;lgimine. Samas saab keha k&auml;sitleda kui vahendajat, mis ei koonda endale kogu t&auml;helepanutervikut, vaid osutab lavamaastiku muudele osistele. Staatilisus ei viita t&uuml;hjusele, vaid r&uuml;tmile ruumis, milles keha asub. D&uuml;naamilisus ei viita t&otilde;estamisvajadusele, vaid totaalsele ruumile.<br />Art shows peab publik usaldama ka rekvisiitide ja kunstniku vahelist r&uuml;tmi, milles silm paneb ise loo kokku. Pinge moodustub visuaalkomponentide omavahelisest suhtest. Kunstnik-k&auml;ivitaja positsioon on aimatav mitte eeldatav.<br />Art show m&otilde;jub ruumis justkui eklektiline legend, milles vaataja &uuml;lesanne on tarbida v&otilde;imalikult palju visuaalset materjali. Struktuuri irratsionaalsus muudab piltide vaheldumise intensiivseks ja detailiderohkeks. Dekoratsioonide hingestatus t&auml;histab art shows peale illustreeriva elemendi ka kunstniku k&auml;epikenduse funktsiooni lavaruumis. Lavakujundusest saab art shows skulpturaalne element, mille eesm&auml;rk on ruumi m&otilde;&otilde;tmeid estetiseerida.

Euroopa kultuuripealinn Tallinn 2011 programmi kuuluv rahvusvaheline etenduskunstide festival kestab augustikuu l&otilde;puni ning selle raames toimub Tallinnas kokku 24 etendust 16 trupilt 11st riigist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Augusti TantsuFestival pole kunagi kartnud &uuml;letada stereot&uuml;&uuml;pe, neid kas v&otilde;i j&otilde;uga l&otilde;hkudes. Sellest erinev pole kava ka sellel aastal: hiilides, kavaldades, surudes v&otilde;i tantsides lammutavad festivali esinejad piire tantsukunsti ning muude kunstiliikide vahel. Taaskord on eesm&auml;rgiks panna publik imestama, r&otilde;&otilde;mustama, vihkama ja m&otilde;tisklema.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Festivali teist n&auml;dalt alustab &uuml;ks kohaliku tantsuskeene tippkollektiive - ZUGA &uuml;hendatud tantsijad, kes t&auml;histasid hiljuti oma 10. s&uuml;nnip&auml;eva ning ilmutasid sellega seoses omap&auml;rase lavastuse &bdquo;Kohe n&auml;ha, et vanad s&otilde;brad\". S&otilde;prusest ja ajast r&auml;&auml;kivat lavastust saab peale Augusti TantsuFestivali n&auml;ha ka Draama festivali p&otilde;hiprogrammis 7. ja 8. septembril Tartus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Teisip&auml;eval, 23. augustil, on festivali kavas kaks lavastust. Kell 19:00 astub Von Krahli Teatris publiku ette &bdquo;tantsiv jurist\" Poolast. Aastaid tagasi l&otilde;petas Rafal Dziemidok oma juurakarj&auml;&auml;ri, et p&uuml;handuda tantsukunstile. Tallinnas n&auml;htav \"Floe\" pole koreograafiline soolo, kuigi seda esitab vaid &uuml;ks tantsija. See on looming, mis p&otilde;hineb ruumi, valguse ja heli sees liikumisel ning on inspireeritud islandi helilooja Jon Leifs\'i loomingul. See on elav pilt, mis laotub &uuml;le aja.</p>\r\n<p>Seej&auml;rel j&auml;tkub &otilde;htu Kanuti Gildi SAALis prantslase David Wampach\'i f&uuml;&uuml;siliselt j&otilde;ulise l&uuml;hietendusega \"Battement\", mis seab kahtluse alla klassikalise balleti kuulsa k&otilde;rge jalal&ouml;&ouml;gi grand battement\'i. Seda liigutust aluseks v&otilde;ttes luuakse dialoog kolme tantsija vahel. David Wampach\'i v&otilde;ib kindlasti lugeda &uuml;heks Euroopa tantsumaastiku t&otilde;usvaks t&auml;heks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kolmap&auml;eval j&auml;tkuvad festivali etendused taas Von Krahli Teatris, kus esmakordselt astub meie publiku ette omap&auml;rane Soome-&Scaron;oti f&uuml;&uuml;silise teatri trupp Oblivia. \"Entertainment Island 2\" on hirmnaljakas kujutis elustiilist, kus kohalik kultuur kohtub &uuml;leilmsega.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nagu esimesel, nii ka sel n&auml;dalal on Augusti TantsuFestivali kavas ka etendusi avalikus ruumis. Belgia trupp t.r.a.n.s.i.t.s.c.a.p.e. toob Tallinna oma spetsiaalselt konstrueeritud haagissuvila ning selles ja selle &uuml;mbruses nende eripalgeline kolmik-lavastus aset leiabki. Neljap&auml;eva &otilde;htul ollakse Tammsaare pargis ning laup&auml;eval Pikal t&auml;naval.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reedel annavad Von Krahli Teatris oma etenduse Jared Gradinger ja Angela Schubot Berliinist. F&uuml;&uuml;siliselt k&uuml;lluslikus duetis otsitakse tingimusteta intiimse koosolu v&otilde;imalikust.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>N&auml;dalavahetusel astub Augusti TantsuFestivalil &uuml;les Jaapani kaasaegseteatri trupp FaiFai oma paljur&auml;nnanud lavastusega &bdquo;My name is I LOVE YOU\". L&auml;bi aasiap&auml;rase huumoriprisma jutustakse lugu hirmust, mida me tunneme armastuse poole liikudes. Kaasaja Jaapani noorte kultuurist inspiratsiooni ammutav trupp on oma kodumaal &uuml;ks hinnatumaid.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 saab teoks t&auml;nu partneritele: Eesti Kultuuriministeerium, Tallinna Kultuuriv&auml;&auml;rtuste Amet, Eesti Kultuurkapital, SA Tallinn 2011, Hispaania suursaatkond, Poola suursaatkond, Flaami v&auml;lisministeerium, Walloonia v&auml;lisministeerium, Prantsuse Kultuurikeskus, EU Japan Fest Japan Commitee ja Euroopa Liidu programm Kultuur.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>T&auml;psem festivali kava ja info:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tantsufestival.ee/\">www.tantsufestival.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kontakid: Festivali kuraator Priit Raud: <a>priit@saal.ee</a>; +372 5010419</p>',0);

The training is physically demanding (most hard for the legs and hips). The purpose is to develop the concentration and the sensation of you body, the articulation of movements and the knowledge how to breathe, work with voice and with different voice resonators.<br />The system is created by Tadashi Suzuki (Japanese theatre director and philosopher). In creating that system he was influenced by classical ballet, Asian martial arts and the actor\'s training system from the traditional Japanese Noh and Kabuki theatre. In the training we concentrate on the lower part of the body (legs) and study how to awake the centrum of energy (in the hips area). Important is to understand how to use that sensation in moving and in speaking. We will stamp and do different walking exercises a lot (legs and hips play an important role in the balance of the body, in standing and in moving). We will study different basic exercises and combine them later with the text. The purpose of the training is to develop the psychophysical wholeness of your body-mind. <br />Welcome to everyone who is interested!<br />One lesson costs 50 EEK (3.19 EUR).<br />Kadi</p>');

The festival in this year in this sense is no exception - the invited artists dismantle the borders of dance art as well as border in between different art forms by sneaking, outmanoeuvring, pressurizing or dancing. The aim of it is to make the spectators wander, enjoy, hate and contemplate at the performances presented in the theatres and on the streets of Tallinn.</p>\r\n<p>Curator of the festival Priit Raud says, \"Current August DanceFestival program is rather balanced, therefore it is hard to highlight someone. Still I would like to mention the cheerful but thoughtful piece \"The Croquis reloaded\" by Spanish artist Cuqui Jeres and the performance of faifai company \"My name is I LOVE YOU\" as an example of looking at the world through the eyes of young Japanese artists. Festival will end with the Estonian premiere of the new first time bigger group work by Mart Kangro.</p>\r\n<p>Remarkable is the fact that like in 2010 the festival breaks out of the theatre spaces moving to the streets of Tallinn aiming to reach the spectators.</p>\r\n<p>More precise info and program is available at:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tantsufestival.ee\">www.tantsufestival.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>August DanceFestival tickets &nbsp;and festival passports on sale with good price from June 15 until August 7.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Contact: Priit Raud / curator of the festival: priit@saal.ee; +372 5010419</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',0);

Luminoso)&nbsp;- a solo for Raido M&auml;gi. The piece is oblivion and loneliness and the piece takes place inside a glass box that has previously been used by Raul Rajangu (painter, installator, multimedia artist). The performance can be seen at Viru Centre Atrium on August 18-20.</p>\r\n<p>On August 18 there will be the premiere of the audio-performance \"ONE TRIP/ONE NOISE\" at the Estonian National Broadcasting Studio I by Tarmo Tagamets. This piece is inspired by the music of French rock band Noir D&eacute;sir (1983-2010). More precisely their legendary album \"Des Visages des Figures\" that was released on 11.09.2001. The director says, \"Basically it is \"a trip within the associations and soundscapes\" that are at the same time wild, rocking and intimate audio experience, placing the contemporary theatre, music and rock-music into no man land.\" Spectators are invited to the live casting at the radio studio I of the Estonian National Broadcasting. Performance team consists of musical director Tauno Aits, performers Riina Maidre (Von Krahl Thetre), Gert Raudsep (Theatre NO99), Taavi T&otilde;nisson (Estonian Puppet and Youth Theatre), Uku Uusberg (Eesti Draamateater), Taavi Kerikm&auml;e (Improtest, ASK:, ansambel U:)</p>\r\n<p>On August 31 the Estonian premiere of the piece \"Talk To Me\" by Mart Kangro will take place. This piece is all about the problematic of performativity. Mart Kangro\'s commentary: \"In addition to the fact that \"Talk to Me\" is zigzagging on the border separating the characters and the spectators, playing with the duality of addressee and recipient with humour, it also tries to describe the microcosm of one individual.\" On stage are Kaja Kann, Vera Nevanlinna, Juha Valkeap&auml;&auml;, Taavi Kerikm&auml;e, Mart Kangro.</p>\r\n<p>More precise program and info is available at: <a href=\"http://www.tantsufestival.ee\">www.tantsufestival.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>August DanceFestival tickets and festival passports on sale with good price from June 15 until August 7.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Contact: Priit Raud / curator of the festival: priit@saal.ee; +372 5010419</p>',0);

David Wampach\'i v&otilde;ib kindlasti lugeda &uuml;heks Euroopa tantsumaastiku t&otilde;usvaks t&auml;heks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kolmap&auml;eval j&auml;tkuvad festivali etendused taas Von Krahli Teatris, kus esmakordselt astub meie publiku ette omap&auml;rane Soome-&Scaron;oti f&uuml;&uuml;silise teatri trupp Oblivia. \"Entertainment Island 2\" on hirmnaljakas kujutis elustiilist, kus kohalik kultuur kohtub &uuml;leilmsega.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nagu esimesel, nii ka sel n&auml;dalal on Augusti TantsuFestivali kavas ka etendusi avalikus ruumis. Belgia trupp t.r.a.n.s.i.t.s.c.a.p.e. toob Tallinna oma spetsiaalselt konstrueeritud haagissuvila ning selles ja selle &uuml;mbruses nende eripalgeline kolmik-lavastus aset leiabki. Neljap&auml;eva &otilde;htul ollakse Tammsaare pargis ning laup&auml;eval Pikal t&auml;naval.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reedel annavad Von Krahli Teatris oma etenduse Jared Gradinger ja Angela Schubot Berliinist. F&uuml;&uuml;siliselt k&uuml;lluslikus duetis otsitakse tingimusteta intiimse koosolu v&otilde;imalikust.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>N&auml;dalavahetusel astub Augusti TantsuFestivalil &uuml;les Jaapani kaasaegseteatri trupp FaiFai oma paljur&auml;nnanud lavastusega &bdquo;My name is I LOVE YOU\". L&auml;bi aasiap&auml;rase huumoriprisma jutustakse lugu hirmust, mida me tunneme armastuse poole liikudes. Kaasaja Jaapani noorte kultuurist inspiratsiooni ammutav trupp on oma kodumaal &uuml;ks hinnatumaid.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 saab teoks t&auml;nu partneritele: Eesti Kultuuriministeerium, Tallinna Kultuuriv&auml;&auml;rtuste Amet, Eesti Kultuurkapital, SA Tallinn 2011, Hispaania suursaatkond, Poola suursaatkond, Flaami v&auml;lisministeerium, Walloonia v&auml;lisministeerium, Prantsuse Kultuurikeskus, EU Japan Fest Japan Commitee ja Euroopa Liidu programm Kultuur.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>T&auml;psem festivali kava ja info:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tantsufestival.ee/\">www.tantsufestival.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kontakid: Festivali kuraator Priit Raud: <a>priit@saal.ee</a>; +372 5010419</p>',0);

Augusti l&otilde;pus on ootamas kaks n&auml;dalat t&auml;is eriilmelisi lavastusi nii Tallinn teatrites kui t&auml;navatel alustades kohalikest tegijatest ja l&otilde;petades k&uuml;lalistega Jaapanist. Augusti TantsuFestival pole kunagi kartnud &uuml;letada stereot&uuml;&uuml;pe, neid kas v&otilde;i j&otilde;uga l&otilde;hkudes. Sellest erinev pole kava ka sellel aastal: hiilides, kavaldades, surudes v&otilde;i tantsides lammutavad festivali esinejad piire tantsukunsti ning muude kunstiliikide vahel. Taaskord on eesm&auml;rgiks panna publik imestama, r&otilde;&otilde;mustama, vihkama ja m&otilde;tisklema etendustel nii Tallinna teatrites kui t&auml;navatel.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 piletim&uuml;&uuml;k algab 15. juunil, mil m&uuml;&uuml;ki l&auml;hevad:</span></strong><br /> -&uuml;ksikpiletid etendustele soodushinnaga 5/8 EUR kuni 07.08 ja alates 08.08 on &uuml;ksikpiletid hinnaga 8/11 EUR Piletimaailmas <a href=\"http://www.piletimaailm.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.piletimaailm.com</a> ja Piletilevis <a href=\"http://www.piletilevi.ee\" target=\"_blank\">www.piletilevi.ee</a><br /> -piiratud koguses FESTIVALI PASSE hinnaga 25/50 EUR, festivali pass tagab sissep&auml;&auml;su k&otilde;igile festivali &uuml;ritustele Piletimaailmas kuni 8. augustini<br /> -piiratud koguses FESTIVALI V&Auml;IKESI PASSE hinnaga 15/24 EUR, mis &nbsp;tagavad sissep&auml;&auml;su 4-le etendusele, mida saab osta ainult Piletilevi kassadest ning sobivad etendused tuleb v&auml;lja valida koha peal kuni 8. augustini</p>\r\n<p>*soodustus kehtib &otilde;pilastele, &uuml;li&otilde;pilastele ja pension&auml;ridele!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Augusti TantsuFestival 2011 programm:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>15.08 / 20:00 Kanuti Gildi SAAL<br /> <strong>GUNILLA HEILBORN </strong>/Stockholm/: <strong>This Is Not A Love Story</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>16.08 / 20:00 Eesti Rahvusraamatukogu amfiteater<br /> <strong>MIHKEL ERNITS &amp; LAURA KVELSTEIN</strong> /Tallinn/: <strong>It was good while it lasted</strong> (feat.
